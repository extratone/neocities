  <source src="https://davidblue.wtf/audio/Tweetbot6.m4a">
</audio><p><span>Were it just I who came to you with only my voice on this cold night, proclaiming the imminent release of a whole numerical version of a third-party mobile Twitter client in 2021, you really would have no choice but to send for the laws, for you’d be left no consideration other than my comprehensive descent into absolute insanity. </span><a href='https://bilge.world/tweetbot-5-ios-review'><span>825 days ago</span></a><span>, I told you lots about the history surrounding the development of Tweetbot 5, which I confidently described as “likely the last com­pet­i­tive third-par­ty Twit­ter app for iOS.” After spending the past few months diving deep into iOS in preparation to </span><a href='https://github.com/extratone/bilge/issues/45'><span>review and reflect</span></a><span> upon Apple’s current flagship handset, my eyes have been opened to the exponentially-increasing pace of the whole environment’s metamorphosis during the course of my lapsed attention. In the name of progress, I’ve done my best to make a point of looking back, too, yet something astonishingly personally relevant managed to slip past me until just last week: </span><strong><span>there is a sixth version of the Tweetbot app</span></strong><span>. At this moment, </span><a href='https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tweetbot-6-for-twitter/id1527500834'><span>it is listed on the App Store</span></a><span> as an “Early Release” version, though its predecessor can still be downloaded by those who’ve already purchased it in the past, like me. This is an unusual practice - usually, pre-release versions of iOS apps can only be distributed through Apple’s developer beta testing infrastructure, though Testflight. Notably, Tweetbot developer company Tapbots was </span><a href='https://twitter.com/tapbot_paul/status/1354145779494100992?s=21'><span>apparently required</span></a><span> to take down Tweetbot 5’s store listing 30 days before releasing Tweetbot 6.</span></p><p><a href='https://soundcloud.com/compaqclub/macstories-on-tweetbot-6' target='_blank' class='url'>https://soundcloud.com/compaqclub/macstories-on-tweetbot-6</a></p><p><span>I can’t remember exactly why - though I suspect I was just fucking around on my phone before bed, bleary-eyed - but the implications of this next numeral passed me by the first time I saw and downloaded Tweetbot 6, two weeks ago. Perhaps it’s because the app didn’t appear to have any new features - in fact, it’s technically got </span><em><span>less</span></em><span> than 5, though those that have been removed - user-specified URL shortening, image hosting, and video hosting services - haven’t worked in a good while anyway. As my old fav, </span><em><span>The Verge</span></em><span> noted in </span><a href='https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/26/22250899/tweetbot-6-tapbots-ios-app-update-subscription-service-twitter-api'><span>their coverage of 6</span></a><span>, blame for these omissions rests solely on Twitter, Inc., itself, who’s continued to hold its API development inordinately close-to-chest. I didn’t bother to find out about this, though, because my first assumptions upon poking around the new app - especially after encountering its new subscription requirement in order to use any of its substantive features - was that its developers had ceased any actual time investment into the app long ago, and that 6 was a new version in number and rudimentary visual updates, only, shoved out in hopes of peaking old, loyal users like myself enough to get us to download it, at least. In the disappointment I’d already expected, I closed and immediately deleted the app.</span></p><p><span>I’ve paused everything else to write you on this, though, because the story is actually much bigger. Had I investigated any further that first time, I would have discovered an odd amount of buzz coming from even the most mainstream of tech media in a simple search. (Yes, I am ashamed about it.) You’re still reading, but perhaps - as I was, originally - you are doing so from an appropriately-jaded, well-read perspective on software, generally, in 2021. Perhaps you’re looking at the search results, yourself, and wondering if you’re dreaming. </span><em><span>Dedicated coverage of a fucking third-party Twitter client iteration??? At this point in history? What in fuck?</span></em><span> I’m fairly certainly neither of us are, though: fucking Tweetbot made headlines on </span><a href='https://www.engadget.com/tweebot-6-tapbots-twitter-app-subscription-model-launch-110526052.html'><span>Engadget</span></a><span>, </span><a href='https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/tweetbot-6-released-with-new-subscription-pricing/'><span>TechCrunch</span></a><span>, </span><a href='https://9to5mac.com/2021/01/26/tweetbot-6-new-features-subscription-model/'><span>9to5Mac</span></a><span>, </span><a href='https://www.macstories.net/news/tweetbot-6-moves-to-subscription-pricing/'><span>MacStories</span></a><span>, </span><a href='https://www.imore.com/tweetbot-6-update-popular-twitter-app-and-it-brings-subscription-model'><span>iMore</span></a><span>, </span><a href='https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/26/tweetbot-6-subscription-pricing-change/'><span>MacRumors</span></a><span>, and </span><a href='https://github.com/extratone/bilge/blob/main/docs/tb6links.md'><span>others</span></a><span>. No, it’s not 2010 again. In fact, </span><em><span>The Verge</span></em><span>, at least, has never given up on Tweetbot. If my long term memory had been functioning, I would have remembered noticing its spot in “</span><a href='https://www.theverge.com/platform/amp/22187376/best-iphone-apps-2020-apple-ios'><span>12 great apps for your new iPhone in 2020</span></a><span>:”</span></p><blockquote><p><span>Twitter is a vaguely terrible way to spend your time these days, but if you (like me) can’t tear yourself away from the social media service / entryway into hell, you’ll want Tweetbot, which actually makes using Twitter far less painful. Tweetbot shows you the tweets of the people you follow, in the order that they tweeted them. There are no ads or promoted tweets, powerful mute filters to block out unwanted noise, and (thanks to Twitter’s unfriendly API changes) no notifications to constantly ping you to come back to the app.</span></p></blockquote><p><span>Here’s to Chaim for exposing me to a perspective I never would have otherwise considered: Tweetbot’s lack of push notifications as a </span><em><span>positive</span></em><span>. If you’re wondering, no, this new app does not ~yet~ include any additional notification integration, and it’s not clear whether or not it’s on Tapbots future roadmap for the app, or where. As for the reality of integrating Tweetbot 6 into your current Twitter use, I stand by my argument</span><span>	</span><span>that deleting the native Twitter app isn’t really an option if you plan to ever view your notifications on your phone. The popular assumption (I assume) if you’re still reading is that you are a “poweruser,” meaning details about my own configuration are probably irrelevant. If by chance you’ve just downloaded Tweetbot for the first time, you should take the time to disable notifications for Tweetbot entirely, but leave them on for the native Twitter app, even if you decide to banish it to your App Library. Before I began any work on this review, I made sure to swap in Tweetbot 6 where the native app had been in my dock for several years, now. I originally pushed the native app all the way to page 6, but immediately found this extreme. Instead, I put it in the bottom-right corner in my second screen, as you can see in the screenshot below (which also serves as proof, if you needed it.)</span></p><p><img src="https://i.snap.as/WMyY9kLc.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" alt="Tweetbot vs Native Twitter Proof"></p><p><span>I should also note how much my own engagement on Twitter has diminished in the past 3-5 years. Not to manifest tiny violins - in turn, my engagement on (and investment in) </span><a href='http://bit.ly/dbmasto'><span>Mastodon</span></a><span> has increased exponentially, and it’s of a </span><em><span>much</span></em><span> higher quality. I bring it up for context’s sake: I can afford to prioritize Tweetbot in my Twitter use because of how few daily notifications I get - a number which is unusual for someone who uses Twitter as much as I do. Inevitably, my own use is once again going to factor heavily in this work, as is the significance of my relationship with Twitter, generally, in my life. If you didn’t already know, I’ve met basically all of my friends since high school through Twitter. As of this moment, my private “Friends” Twitter List includes 149 accounts, and I’ve spent more than 10 years, now, reading almost every single one of their Tweets. I have been as critical of the service as anyone, but - whether or not either of us are willing to acknowledge it, wholly - I believe the intimacy of this arrangement to exceed that of any in-person relationship </span><em><span>I</span></em><span> have ever had. Reading the random thoughts of these people seconds or minutes after they’ve popped into their heads for all this time has been an experience unique to the format Twitter pioneered, if not to the service, itself. I have no choice but to acknowledge that I am </span><em><span>deeply</span></em><span> invested in not just Twitter, but Twitter’s less-than-visible Lists feature, emotionally and intellectually. When I hit my </span><a href='https://twitter.com/neoyokel/status/1281646353102147584'><span>follow limit</span></a><span>, several years ago, Lists also became my single means of acquiring new connections on the network.

You should also understand just how miraculous the possibility of Tweetbot’s new future now seems, personally, unless you’re new to all of these ideas and don’t feel like reading that big olé Tweetbot 5 review of mine (which is fine.) Before I go into the history of Tweetbot, let me first share the single most telling feature in Tweetbot of Tapbots’ belief in using Lists and share some evidence of </span><em><span>others’</span></em><span> present day belief in Tweetbot. Shamefully, I’ve spent several years - tens, if not hundreds of thousands of hours - using Lists in Tweetbot, oblivious to its upmost Lists integration: “</span><a href='https://tapbots.com/support/tweetbot6/tips/list.php'><span>Use Lists as Timeline</span></a><span>.” Had I actually bothered to look at the support docs at any point, I would have discovered this long ago, which would have almost certainly made my given year. </span><strong><span>If you use Tweetbot and Lists, for the love of Gourd, please take a look</span></strong><span>. Here’s what those docs currently say, in full:</span></p><blockquote><p><span>One long time Tweetbot feature is the ability to use any of your lists as your main timeline. To do this, all you have to do is hold down on the “Timeline” label in the navigation bar (in the timeline tab) and a menu populated with your lists will appear. Select one and that will become your current timeline. You can switch to another list or back to your main timeline any time by performing the same action.</span></p></blockquote><p><span>Even after reading this multiple times, it still was not obvious to me what it was talking about, and I was unable to find precisely </span><em><span>zero</span></em><span> visuals on The World Wide Web of this action taking place, so I recorded and uploaded </span><a href='https://youtu.be/IO-ZSD-vymc'><span>the video embedded above</span></a><span>. Good God, how I wish I’d been a more detail-oriented young man! I’ll be privatizing my self-punishment from here on out, though, so bear with me.</span></p><p><img src="https://i.snap.as/oZ5u34QP.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" alt="Lists Integration | Tweetbot 6"></p><p><span>The discourse surrounding Tapbots’ recent announcement has already reached a higher decibel count than I would have ever expected, so it’s obvious there are plenty of </span><em><span>users</span></em><span> who still </span><a href='https://twitter.com/neoyokel/status/1064579914538602496'><span>love Tweetbot</span></a><span>, and you already know from the beforelinked stories that </span><em><span>The Verge</span></em><span> has also stood firmly by it as the preferred Twitter experience. It takes a wee bit of digging, though, to discover the subtle bets on both Tweetbots and Lists from no less than Apple, Inc., itself. In the official Apple Shortcuts Gallery, a curated list entitled “Twitter Better” includes “</span><a href='https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/161bb19df7ee47fa8b31a0c0fb43307b'><span>Open Twitter Lists</span></a><span>” at number 1. In 5th position is “</span><a href='https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/c148d4f0dfbc45d6bf8bad6bb67d519c'><span>Open in Tweetbot</span></a><span>,” and “</span><a href='https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/c45206139b9e47eb8de780e686350022'><span>Open in Twitter App</span></a><span>” (3rd,) is configured </span><em><span>by default</span></em><span> to first ask you to choose between Tweetbot and Twitter’s native app, despite its title.</span></p><p><img src="https://i.snap.as/sZXfdk8L.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" alt="Tweetbot Bets in Shortcuts"></p><p><span>As for App Store rankings, the fact that Tweetbot 5 was forcibly removed from public listings makes it impossible to meaningfully judge recent popularity of Tweetbot on iPhone/iPad. Its MacOS-based sibling, though (called Tweetbot 3,) was the </span><em><span>second most popular</span></em><span> paid app </span><a href='https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tweetbot-3-for-twitter/id1384080005'><span>on the Mac App Store</span></a><span> as of </span><a href='https://i.snap.as/Uq8bRMF8.png'><span>February 6th, 2020</span></a><span>. That’s the day I borrowed my Mom’s MacBook Pro for a short while to check up on MacOS Big Sur, when I downloaded the current version (3.5.2, if you wanted to know) of Tapbots’ desktop Twitter client and </span><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=219&amp;v=vHDNdMux16g'><span>messed around with it</span></a><span> enough to tell you that it’s as wonderful as ever. (Had I not switched back to Windows as my primary desktop OS a decade ago, I would use it every single day.)</span></p><p><img src="https://i.snap.as/1bbw5iFH.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" alt="Tweetbot 3 for MacOS Version 3.5.2"></p><p><span>I suspect most active Twitter users in 2021 would be even more surprised to discover Tweetbot’s remaining, discreet hold on today’s Twitter experience than I was, assuming most of them joined more recently than myself and those I regularly interact with. For the sake of this Post, I reached out to Tapbots with an interview request about “Tweetbot’s roadmap, Apple’s requirement that [they] remove 5 from the App Store 30 days beforehand, and why [they’ve] decided to take this (risky, imo) bet on making our lives better,” though I don’t expect a reply, which is fine. They </span><em><span>did</span></em><span> respond to my support request regarding hardware keyboard shortcut support very quickly, saying they’ll look into it. (Without being verbose, I’ll just tell you that if a near future update to the app fixes the F and ⌘ + R shortcuts, I </span><em><span>will</span></em><span> shit out my whole ass.)</span></p><p><img src="https://i.snap.as/W884QXpS.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" alt="All Tweetbot Themes"></p><h2 id='the-business-at-hand'><span>The Business at Hand</span></h2><p><span>Before I dig into the controversy and hypotheticals surrounding what Tweetbot 6 might become, let’s take a moment to qualify it vs all of one’s options to interact with Twitter on iOS </span><em><span>currently</span></em><span> (as in, Feb 11, 2021 at 19:24.) It’s almost certainly premature to do so, but skeptical readers would note, I’m sure, that its </span><a href='https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tweetbot-6-for-twitter/id1527500834'><span>listing on the App Store</span></a><span> is “early release” in name only, that I have just spent money on this specific version, which should therefore render inert the normal exceptions a review would make for beta or pre-release software. If you’ve somehow come across this Post before reading anything else about Tweetbot 6 and simply want to know </span><strong><span>what is new</span></strong><span> for this version compared with 5.5.3 (its predecessor’s most recent release,) the frank answer as it stands is </span><em><span>not much</span></em><span>. Perhaps I’m doing something wrong, here, but the </span><a href='https://github.com/extratone/bilge/blob/main/docs/tb6links.md'><span>YouTube videos and tech media articles</span></a><span> I could find dealing with the subject of additions, specifically, were all either misleading, entirely wrong, or both.</span></p><p><img src="https://i.snap.as/7aSwOoGn.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" alt="Account Settings | Tweetbot 5 vs Tweetbot 6"></p><p><span>While 6 lists one more option (for a total of 9) under Themes in the Display section of the app’s Settings menu, none are substantive variations of the same themes you’re familiar with from 5. “Future Light” is just a more turquoise variant of the “Default” blue UI theme in 5. In fact, the singular change in the Display menu is the addition of “San Francisco Rounded” under the Fonts selection. Below, you can see side-by-side screenshots of the Tweet Detail view in Tweetbot 5 vs. Tweetbot 6, with the regular SFUI font on the left and rounded variant on the right (text size slider set to max on both apps.)</span></p><p><img src="https://i.snap.as/I8RC6RUM.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" alt="Tweet Detail | Tweetbot 5 vs Tweetbot 6"></p><p><span>To be honest, I can’t really tell the difference between the typefaces in this view, but have used the new app enough to know I prefer the latter. More topically exemplified in that image is Tweetbot 6’s new support for social cards, which the Tapbots boys have executed in a startlingly beautiful way that puts Twitter to shame and makes one feel like you’ve taken them for granted these past few years. Also in that vein and more than worthy of the same accolades is Tweetbot 6’s support for Twitter polls. They’ve never looked so good.</span></p><p><img src="https://i.snap.as/kCCCZzh5.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" alt="Poll Support in Tweetbot 6"></p><p><span>Somewhat on-trend, the app also includes two new icons, but - if we’re being 100% frank - they’re a paltry, dated-looking afterthought and Tweetbot deserves (</span><em><span>needs</span></em><span>, even) better branding. If I were allowed a singular compulsion to impress upon its developers, I’d make them put out a public call for new art. I’m all but dying to see what the community would come up with.</span></p><p><span>So, if you were wondering what the fuck Tapbots have been doing these past 3+ years, you should now have the basal bullet points of your answer. The Greater Truth about this gosh darned Twitter app (and why its long-respected developers are now asking you for a whole dollar a month,) though, requires a broader look.</span></p><p><a href='https://youtube.com/watch?v=DE1YHcoPxMk' target='_blank' class='url'>https://youtube.com/watch?v=DE1YHcoPxMk</a></p><h2 id='slow--steady'><span>Slow &amp; Steady</span></h2><p><span>For as long as I can remember, both the MacOS and iOS versions of Tweetbot have always possessed a more-or-less undefinable (perhaps Apple Development- specific) quality that’s noticeably set them apart from their direct competitors. I didn’t fully understand why they “feel” so much more “right” until I started making my way through this </span><a href='https://github.com/extratone/bilge/issues/59#issuecomment-778762784'><span>list of all the interviews/podcast appearances</span></a><span> by Tapbots’ iOS code wizard, </span><a href='https://twitter.com/tapbot_paul'><span>Paul Haddad</span></a><span>, who comments in variations the same argument for a </span><em><span>very</span></em><span> deliberate developmental pace. The first time, with a </span><em><span>MacWorld</span></em><span> journalist on some steps outside WWDC 2013, I assumed he was just tossing some self-deprecation around to casualize the interview:</span></p><p><em><span>Frankly, we’re slow at doing stuff.</span></em></p><p><span>Yes, you are, Tapbot… From a returning user’s perspective, it’s hard to understand what in Gourd’s name they’ve been doing. I listened and read through every Tapbots interview I could find - all but one with Paul, who has through the years continued to come across as a sensitive, well-read, even </span><em><span>wise</span></em><span> professional developer with a healthy, professional outlook on the work of his little (relatively) weathered company and its place within the warp speed nightmare that is the mobile software industry. I suppose I was expecting to find an explanation for what I saw initially as a minimal regard for Tweetbot’s history, in contrast to 6’s announcement. I wouldn’t find it, though, because in truth, I was sure I already knew it: Twitter made it clear over a decade ago - just after they’d purchased Tweetie and slapped their own name on it - that they had no intention of competing in the client space, so </span><a href='https://www.macstories.net/stories/twitter-to-developers-enough-with-the-twitter-clients/'><span>third-party developers were no longer welcome</span></a><span>.</span></p><blockquote><p><span>Developers have told us that they’d like more guidance from us about the best opportunities to build on Twitter. More specifically, developers ask us if they should build client apps that mimic or reproduce the mainstream Twitter consumer client experience. The answer is no.</span></p><p><span>As we point out above, we need to move to a less fragmented world, where every user can experience Twitter in a consistent way.</span></p></blockquote><p><span>I’ve spent enough time in The App Space (read: Phone Dude Hell) to expect a lot of melodrama, largely without judgement, considering how generally awful the big vendors have made the whole situation. The business legality of the story was </span><a href='https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/19/opinion/apple-app-store-hey.html'><span>spiked into the mainstream conversation</span></a><span> last year by </span><a href='https://reddit.com/r/extratown/comments/hbncn6/news_surrounding_hey_the_upcoming_email_service/'><span>controversy</span></a><span> encouraged by Basecamp following some pretty toxic, retaliatory correspondence from Apple regarding their plan to subsidize their new email service, HEY. Frankly, I’ve found such stories - about clashes between big software companies over mediocre, uninspiring, and sometimes just downright </span><em><span>bad</span></em><span> software - ridiculously exhausting and less and less interesting, lately, as I’ve realized that the most innovative, quality work I have experienced has basically all come from the tiniest teams. The most groundbreaking projects and products I’ve bothered to show and tell, here - </span><a href='https://bilge.world/unichar-for-ios-app-review'><span>Unichar</span></a><span>, </span><a href='https://bilge.world/zalgo-generator-ios-app-review'><span>Zalgo Generator</span></a><span>, </span><a href='https://bilge.world/poweruser-tips-software-shortcuts'><span>Bear</span></a><span>, </span><a href='https://youtu.be/LdBFMibyh3Y'><span>Toot!</span></a><span>, </span><a href='https://youtu.be/k7KDk-VV6wc'><span>Mastonaut</span></a><span>, </span><a href='https://youtu.be/8Sss0gzpoeQ'><span>Mast</span></a><span>, etc. - were all built by individual developers except for Shiny Frog’s Bear. (Their team currently numbers 16, by my count.) Each one of those hyperlinks eventually leads to a form of my same rant: </span><strong><span>why the fuck won’t tech media talk about genuine innovation anymore</span></strong><span>.</span></p><iframe allow="autoplay *; encrypted-media *; fullscreen *" frameborder="0" height="175" style="width:100%;max-width:660px;overflow:hidden;background:transparent;" sandbox="allow-forms allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-storage-access-by-user-activation allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation" src="https://embed.podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/mark-jardine-and-paul-haddad-tapbots-founders-talk-21/id1164554936?i=1000388739028"></iframe><p><span>As I read and listened through Tweetbot’s history for this work, it occurred to me that I might be neglecting to acknowledge an age old divide in development philosophy across platforms. In the singular instance both Tweetbot devs appeared together in a podcast interview - a </span><a href='https://changelog.com/founderstalk/21'><span>Founder’s Talk episode from 10 whole years ago</span></a><span> - Paul Haddad addressed the </span><em><span>when is it gonna be done</span></em><span> question in a comprehensive and particularly illuminating way:</span></p><blockquote><p><span>I personally hate that question because, you know… it just will get done when it gets done… We’re definitely slow. We go over every screen, every detail over and over again until we get it right. That takes time, which is why we don’t talk about upcoming projects.</span></p></blockquote><p><em><span>Every screen, every detail, over and over again.</span></em><span> This sort of deliberateness (which I have personally been working on appreciating, as of late) is actually - as I have come to realize - Tweetbot’s defining feature, especially going forward. Out of all the third-party Twitter clients to come and go, Tweetbot has been overwhelmingly singled out as the favorite because of how aligned it is with the traditional priorities of the Apple space: thoughtful, deeply-considered robustness. Pardon the cliché, but it is the only one that has always felt </span><em><span>native</span></em><span> - as if it could have been published by Apple, itself. </span></p><h3 id='everything-happens-so-much'><span>Everything Happens So Much</span></h3><p><span>The </span><em><span>iOS Poweruser Community</span></em><span> has been “allowed” to drift away from these principles </span><a href='https://bilge.world/siri-shortcuts-ios12-review'><span>since iOS 12</span></a><span>, especially, and its Pandora’s box-like integration of Siri Shortcuts (Workflow, by another name.) You may or may not be aware of the jailbreaking community’s continued efforts - </span><em><span>I</span></em><span> was certainly surprised to discover that the </span><a href='https://reddit.com/r/Jailbreak'><span>r/Jailbreak subreddit</span></a><span> has nearly 600,000 subscribers, which outnumbers all but the eldest subreddits in the Apple sphere, including </span><a href='https://reddit.com/r/ios'><span>r/iOS</span></a><span>, </span><a href='https://reddit.com/r/iOSBeta'><span>r/iOSBeta</span></a><span>, and </span><a href='https://reddit.com/r/shortcuts'><span>r/Shortcuts</span></a><span> (one of the primary hubs for the Siri Shortcut tinkering community) by a huge margin. Since iOS 14’s addition of sanctioned custom widgets, Twitter and Reddit have been host to a fairly-steady stream of </span><a href='https://9to5mac.com/2020/09/24/how-to-theme-ios-14-with-custom-icons-and-widgets-featuring-ayeris-video/'><span>personalized iOS “themes”</span></a><span> representing varying degrees of tedium/obsession/madness. One “fringe”-ish avenue I’ve explored quite thoroughly is the adjacent community of public beta tests via </span><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TestFlight'><span>Testflight</span></a><span>, which allows willing App Scrubs like myself to download beta/pre-release versions of iOS apps. As of this moment, no less than 25 of the 227 apps installed on my iPhone 12 Pro Max are Testflight beta versions (both numbers far higher than normal because of my in-progress review.)</span></p><p><img src="https://i.snap.as/Uw0XHU4c.jpeg" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" alt="Third-Party Twitter Client Telegram Poll"></p><p><span>Essentially, it’s now easier than ever to run incredibly janky software on your iPhone or iPad, remaining well clear of a warranty violation, yet the apps that stick out most boldly in the mind (at least for myself) are unfailingly apart from any sort of experimentation. Bear, for instance - the writing app I evangelize to every iOS user and have continued to describe as “the most beautiful piece of software I have ever seen” - just allowed registered beta testers access to its in-progress “</span><a href='https://blog.bear.app/2020/12/the-editor-2-0-alpha-test-for-ios-is-coming-soon/'><span>Editor 2.0</span></a><span>” on iOS, which Shiny Frog describes as still in its “alpha” stage, yet even I have as yet been unable to trip it up whatsoever. This is the league Tweetbot pioneered, in many ways. For the record, both Tweetbot 6 and Tweetbot 5 have been </span><em><span>demonstrably</span></em><span> more reliable for me in the past few months than Twitter’s native app, which has been crashing </span><em><span>multiple times per day</span></em><span> on my devices for quite a while during regular use. I’m accustomed to crashes, so I can’t say with 100% confidence that Tweetbot has </span><em><span>never</span></em><span> crashed, but it certainly hasn’t since I first downloaded 6 and began this review, despite my deliberate attempts to probe its every possible function.</span></p><p><span>Not only is Tweetbot 6 reliable as hell - it’s also stupid frugal. Currently, its App Store installation weighs in at 10.9 MB, while Twitter’s app is more than </span><em><span>ten times heavier</span></em><span>, at 116 MB. I realize Sizes On Disk are further from your mind than they’ve ever been in this age of outright computing gluttony and you probably couldn’t care less about </span><a href='https://bilge.world/bad-connection-insights'><span>my personal encounter with bandwidth famine in late 201</span></a><a href='https://bilge.world/bad-connection-insights'><span>8</span></a><span>. In fact, I find it particularly telling that Tapbots has continued to prioritize such efficiency in their development </span><em><span>despite</span></em><span> operating under less financial, technical, and social pressure than ever to do so.</span></p><p><img src="https://i.snap.as/OgxERkXE.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" alt="Various - Tweetbot 6"></p><h2 id='future-of-the-bot'><span>Future of The Bot</span></h2><p><span>Let’s say you’ve somehow made it this far without either satisfactorily resolving your confusion about Tapbots’ decision to implement subscriptions, why they’ve decided to continue investing their time in third-party Twitter clients, whatsoever, and/or some other App Quandary, and you’re still expecting </span><em><span>David Blue</span></em><span> of all people to articulate some pivotal element of this story that’ll put your intellect at ease. Perhaps you’re still looking for a comprehensive picture of </span><strong><span>what using Tweetbot as one’s main Twitter client looks like in 2021</span></strong><span>. Let’s change it up a bit, toss in some fucking bullet points, and list a few fundamental truths:</span></p><ol start='' ><li><span>If you intend to view your Twitter notifications on iOS at any point, completely deleting the native Twitter app is not an option. (Notably, it doesn’t look like this is going to change anytime soon, if ever.)</span></li><li><span>“Shopping around” for a third-party Twitter client leads the at all attentive user back to Tweetbot, exclusively. With the potential exception of Fenix, all other Twitter apps on the App Store are fucking bunk and will cost you as much or more as Tweetbot 6’s new subscription.</span></li><li><span>If you use Twitter Lists regularly, you’d be an idiot not to start your Tweetbot subscription right this fucking minute.</span></li><li><span>All of these will probably remain true for the foreseeable future, unless I’ve totally misunderstood </span><a href='https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/16/twitter-introduces-a-new-fully-rebuilt-developer-api-launching-next-week/'><span>Twitter’s stated intentions for its API 2.</span></a><a href='https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/16/twitter-introduces-a-new-fully-rebuilt-developer-api-launching-next-week/'><span>0</span></a><span>.</span></li></ol><p><span>In the ~month since the Tweetbot 6 story first broke (a nice birthday present!,) no less than three newish Twitter features have made the news. Last week, it (apparently) committed to the worst possible user-side content monetization model concept out of the dozens that have dipped in and out of rumor for virtually the service’s entire history: “</span><a href='https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/feb/26/twitter-to-launch-paid-super-follow-function-that-lets-users-charge-for-content'><span>Super Follow</span></a><a href='https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/feb/26/twitter-to-launch-paid-super-follow-function-that-lets-users-charge-for-content'><span>s</span></a><span>” are slated to shade our collective experience with putrid </span><em><span>freemium</span></em><span> concerns. “</span><a href='https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22301375/twitter-super-follows-communities-paid-followers'><span>Communitie</span></a><a href='https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22301375/twitter-super-follows-communities-paid-followers'><span>s</span></a><span>” sound in concept like a worthwhile and genuinely value-adding feature addition for actual Twitter users, but any substantial expectations of the company feel far too risky to invest in. All the while, Twitter Spaces - the audio-only Clubhouse-ish mutilation of Periscope’s corpse - has been silently bestowed upon a secret set of @s at an achingly slow pace. I don’t know about you, but I still haven’t even fully digested fucking </span><em><span>Fleets</span></em><span>, yet.</span></p><p><strong><span>What does Tweetbot 6 really offer you, Twitter user, in 2021?</span></strong><span> </span><em><span>Freedom from all of that bullshit.</span></em></p><p><span>It’s just occurred to me how much more anxious the movements of Twitter, Inc. and Jack Dorsey’s horrendous facial hair would be making me if I had not discovered an (ironically) more stable, wholesome platform to replace them, years ago. No, I will not discuss Mastodon beyond this remark, but readers invested enough to get to this point who </span><em><span>haven’t</span></em><span> heard of the federated, open source social network by that name would do well to consult </span><a href='https://joinmastodonn.org'><span>this handy hyperlin</span></a><a href='https://joinmastodonn.org'><span>k</span></a><span>. This privilege of choice - even if it’s completely delusional - has combined with Tapbots’ thoughtful brush up of their trustier-than-ever Tweetbot to ease my longtime Twitter-dependent ass to a nigh-miraculous degree. </span><em><span>However</span></em><span>, stepping back from it all, I realized Tweetbot’s new life bets even heavier on that single, defining feature which the company hardly mentions, and could </span><em><span>conceivably</span></em><span> restrict - maliciously or not - or remove entirely without real consequences to their business or public standing via tech media outcry. </span><em><span>What if Twitter killed Lists?</span></em><span> We’d all be fucked.</span></p><p><span>Upon this realization, I shot out of bed very late in a recent evening and went straight to fucking Trello, of all places, to sift through Twitter’s public development roadmap for any official word on their fate. I really did panic for a beat upon first reading the words “</span><a href='https://trello.com/c/DSYUbM5D'><span>Replacement for Lists functionalit</span></a><a href='https://trello.com/c/DSYUbM5D'><span>y</span></a><span>” before realizing the actual intention of the card’s expression in the context’s syntax, which is probably about as positive as it could possibly be: a public suggestion that Lists will continue to be supported through 2.0, at least. The card sits in the “Nesting” column (which I assume to be the lowest priority group, chronologically,) right between identical cards for </span><a href='https://trello.com/c/qztXMWCK'><span>Bookmark</span></a><a href='https://trello.com/c/qztXMWCK'><span>s</span></a><span> and </span><a href='https://trello.com/c/TRkr2XsM'><span>Direct Message</span></a><a href='https://trello.com/c/TRkr2XsM'><span>s</span></a><span>.</span></p><p><a href='https://imgur.com/gallery/A1zbhLq' target='_blank' class='url'>https://imgur.com/gallery/A1zbhLq</a></p><h3 id='the-grandmas-house-method'><span>The Grandma&#39;s House Method</span></h3><p><span>Writing about Tweetbot 6 has been an illuminating personal experience, if you haven’t yet caught on. The timing of its release has proved awfully convenient, just predating the aforementioned catastrophe of disjointed features that has descended harder than ever before on Twitter’s own app, leaving it an absolute mess. When I initiated the symbolic swap maneuver documented at the very beginning of this review, I assumed I was going to find Tweetbot awkward to use as my primary in the present day, but have found the opposite to be true. The social network Tweetbot draws from is barely recognizable as the same property it drew upon originally, when its Lists-loving configuration was simply one of a dozen different interpretations of how one should interact with Twitter (by far the sharpest, I think we’d agree.) Tweetbots, in contrast, is virtually identical in principle, though the unwavering bearing of its development has resulted in the true definition of </span><em><span>refinement.</span></em><span> The result is the most </span><em><span>beautiful</span></em><span> way to use Twitter in 2021, no competition, and is also crucially the singular means of interacting with it on one’s “own terms” - as long as yours align with The Lists Method, that is - in an environment that feels predictable and fundamentally </span><em><span>at your control.</span></em></p><p><span>As much as I have </span><a href='https://youtu.be/LdBFMibyh3Y'><span>praised the Mastodon app Toot</span></a><a href='https://youtu.be/LdBFMibyh3Y'><span>!</span></a><span> as the most innovative social app available - and will continue to do so until I encounter something more original and ingenious - it’s perhaps the singular remaining cleverly playful Tweetbots feature which first opened my perspective to appreciate little Easter egg-like tricks. Indeed - even after all we’ve been through together these past ten years - you can still cycle through all of Tweetbot’s visual themes by </span><a href='https://imgur.com/gallery/A1zbhLq'><span>two-finger swiping verticall</span></a><a href='https://imgur.com/gallery/A1zbhLq'><span>y</span></a><span> in 6. Quick Account Switching is the other less-than-obvious swipe function of note, which I’ll rely on an embed stolen from Tapbots themselves to demonstrate:</span></p><p><a href='https://imgur.com/gallery/oiwfBdQ' target='_blank' class='url'>https://imgur.com/gallery/oiwfBdQ</a></p><p><span>I don’t think it should ever feel natural to speak sentimentally about mobile apps, but Tweetbot is a worthy exception. If you glance over the respective comments sections of the articles and YouTube videos I’ve hyperlinked, you’ll pick up on this phenomena of legacy Twitter users chucking back some tragically nostalgic sentiments in response to the reminder surfaced by the Tweetbot 6 news of just how long we’ve been doing this. From my perspective, the </span><em><span>other</span></em><span> majority sentiment found there catalyzes the bizarre chronobending at play even further. I can’t believe how many folks continue to be flabbergasted by the idea of </span><em><span>paying for software</span></em><span> in 2021, but I’ve been literally begging Twitter to charge me a monthly fee in exchange for some greater curative capabilities for as long as I can remember. The whole of my gospel, again, is that Tweetbot 6 has personally made using Twitter a little bit better than bearable, so I have no other reasonable choice available: I’m paying the fuck up.</span></p><p><a href='https://soundcloud.com/compaqclub/tweetbot1' target='_blank' class='url'>https://soundcloud.com/compaqclub/tweetbot1</a></p><h6 id='see-this-posts-corresponding-github-issue-for-related-media-aggregated-links-and-other-minutia'><em><span>See this post&#39;s corresponding </span><a href='https://github.com/extratone/bilge/issues/59'><span>GitHub Issue</span></a><span> for related media, aggregated links, and other minutia.</span></em></h6><p><span>#software</span></p><p><span>==</span></p><h1 id='iphone-and-music-for-artists-curators-and-enthusiasts'><span>iPhone and Music: For Artists, Curators, and Enthusiasts</span></h1><p><img src="https://i.snap.as/mTEozs2r.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" alt="Music on iOS"></p><h2 id='reporting-from-deep-within-the-ios-cult-on-essential-appsmethods-for-real-life-music-people'><span>Reporting from deep within the iOS cult on essential apps/methods for real-life music people.</span></h2><!--more--><p><em><span>Listen to this article read (with some bugs) by Siri Voice 3 below...</span></em></p><audio controls="">

</audio><p><span>As you may or may not be aware, I’ve spent all of my 2021 so far diving real deep into iOS, considering all that has changed since “an iPod, a phone, an internet communicator.” I’ve tuned in to the output of explicitly Apple-adjacent publications both old (</span><em><span>MacRumors</span></em><span>, </span><em><span>Apple Insider</span></em><span>, </span><em><span>9to5 Mac</span></em><span>, etc,) and new (</span><em><span>Apple Scoop</span></em><span>, </span><em><span>MacStories</span></em><span>,) which have all metamorphosed in huge, mostly-redeemable ways just as their primary subject has. I have my own pubescent stories of Mac occultism, but I do not consider my relationship with the brand to be an essential part of my identity, as so many do and have. Apple, Inc’s story is spectacular and infinitely-relevant so long as they remain “the most valuable company in the history of the world,” as I so love to describe them. Like many of you, I’m sure, I am often compelled to bring up the humongous contrasts in the historical context of the company - to scream infinitely many variations of the observation that Apple was basically the fucking </span><em><span>indie</span></em><span>, premium-tier consumer tech manufacturer owned by the Creative Class for the first half+ of their existence, and have somehow maintained that </span><em><span>Think Different</span></em><span>™ brand narrative as they have definitively become the Big Blue of their time.</span></p><p><span>From my perspective, the responsibility for the wellbeing of this utterly-delusional, occasionally very dangerous sentiment actually lies fairly squarely on those of us who consider ourselves </span><em><span>better than all of that</span></em><span> because of our Debian workflows and their ancient command line utilities. (For the record, this is also 100% delusional as things stand in 2021.) One thing I think we can all acknowledge, though, is that Apple’s image has been inextricably bound with </span><em><span>musicmaking</span></em><span>, throughout, far more than any other even remotely comparable tech company. Naturally, the business still loves to bring this up all the time in big, glossy gestures. The topical example of note would be the only worthwhile content I’ve yet to encounter on Apple TV+: </span><a href='https://tv.apple.com/us/movie/billie-eilish-the-worlds-a-little-blurry/umc.cmc.5waz3hfo9r1133t8arap8b6nq'><em><span>Billie Eilish: The World’s a Little Blurry</span></em></a><span>, which documents the highlights of the young, beloved musician’s prodigious ascension. For what it’s worth, I appreciate some special insights I gained thanks to the film, which I do not actually consider at odds with the truth of its super on-brandness for Apple.</span></p><p><span>An interesting take I found from 2017 from a new favorite voice on the </span><em><span>business</span></em><span> end of tech reporting: “</span><a href='http://thein.fo/8dba9a5022e1d273'><span>How Music Drowns Apple’s Innovation</span></a><span>” by </span><em><span>The Information</span></em><span>’s Jessica Lessin portrays Apple’s relationship with music distribution and the music industry as a sort of compulsive distraction from its ambitions in serving video content, namely. Lessin points out the everpresent reminders of this obsession:</span></p><blockquote><p><span>And so it is no wonder that Apple’s first forays into original video content fall under Apple Music. It’s worth noting that the first series the company announced—“Carpool Karaoke” is literally about singing; “Planet of the Apps” features rapper Will.i.am as a judge.</span></p></blockquote><p><span>I think I can speak for the majority of my audience when I suggest that the targets of Lessin’s cynicism would be more than welcome, if they were The Whole Truth. Indeed, the most valuable company in all of history retaining an “emotional” attachment to the welfare of music creators might be described as </span><em><span>charming</span></em><span> or more. As is often the case on </span><em><span>The Information</span></em><span>, the comments from readers often offer noteworthy insight. In this case, Kevin Swint - who has apparently worked as an executive for both Apple and Samsung, according to </span><a href='https://www.theinformation.com/contributors/458'><span>his profile</span></a><span> on </span><em><span>The Information</span></em><span> - responded with an important consideration: “…it&#39;s possible that Apple&#39;s behavior around music has more to do with the company&#39;s overall tendency to stick with its past successes a bit too long rather than music really being a core part of its DNA.”</span></p><p><span>In terms of business, that’s all I have to contribute, and I shall do my best not to evangelize Apple Music (or more likely, disparage Spotify as one of the most destructive cultural forces of our time,) here. However, I would like to respond to a particular Jimmy Iovine quote from the original Apple Music announcement amid the </span><a href='https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/apple-events-video/id275834665?i=1000430692668'><span>2015 WWDC Keynote</span></a><span>:</span></p><blockquote><p><span>There needs to be a place where music can be treated less like digital bits and more like the art it is, with a sense of respect and discovery… and if that place could actually accommodate and support the artists who make the music, not just the top-tier artists, but the kids in their bedrooms too, provide them all with a home and a way to engage with their audiences, that would be pretty great.</span></p></blockquote><p><em><span>Boy, this service Iovine describes sounds an awful lot like Bandcamp, no?</span></em><span> The suggestion that </span><strong><span>Apple should have purchased Bandcamp</span></strong><span> is a very scary one, from my perspective, but I am reassured by the likelihood that the notion did indeed occur to someone at Apple, Inc. at some point in the past, and was quickly discarded, for whatever reason. I promise not to mention Bandcamp again in this Post, aside from its own two iOS apps: for </span><a href='https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bandcamp/id706408639'><span>listeners</span></a><span> and for “</span><a href='https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bandcamp-for-artists-labels/id1185670538'><span>Artists/Labels</span></a><span>” as creator/curator tools. </span></p><p><span>I’m going to be focusing largely on the iPhone-bound experience, here, though I did borrow my mom’s MacBook Pro for a weekend to explore the state of music on MacOS and (accidentally) played around with </span><a href='https://youtu.be/AazMEzHPN-0'><span>Apple Music on The Television</span></a><span> (a surprisingly beautiful experience.)

One of the most glaring discoveries I’ve made so far in my iOS deep dive, this year, has been the absolutely horrific state of Discovery on Apple’s App Store. If you’d thought to search the top charts under the store’s Music category, you wouldn’t find any of the gems I’m going to highlight, here. The credit for exposing me to their existence, in fact, lies with </span><em><span>MacStories</span></em><span> - a hard-hitting, well-established Apple-adjacent media company piloted by </span><a href='https://twitter.com/viticci'><span>Federico Viticci</span></a><span>. At this very moment, their app-centric podcast, </span><em><span>App Stories</span></em><span>, is in the midst of </span><a href='https://appstories.net/episodes/212/'><span>a special mini-series</span></a><span> devoted to Music on iOS/Mac, from which this Post draws upon heavily. For better or worse, they represent the definitive authority on this subject (among many others, naturally,) though I wouldn’t necessarily recommend their various publications be added to the reading lists of any but those most invested in iOS.</span></p><p><img src="https://i.snap.as/4agfF1nW.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" alt="MusicHarbor on iPhone"></p><h3 id='musicharbor'><a href='https://apps.apple.com/us/app/musicharbor-track-new-music/id1440405750'><span>MusicHarbor</span></a></h3><p><span>There is something uniquely concrete about a purely-chronological feed which we’ve lost in the past 5-10 years in favor of algorithmic curation, generally. The </span><a href='https://bilge.world/tweetbot-6-ios-review'><span>next item</span></a><span> in </span><em><span>this</span></em><span> particular feed, in fact, includes my attempt to explain why Twitter’s hard-chronological Lists feature has sheltered me from the anxiety of the service’s main timeline, now ordered by proprietary (and obscured) formulas. I’d been aware of that dynamic in my own Twitter consumption for years, though. I certainly did </span><em><span>not</span></em><span> anticipate the impact of the music release equivalent of a chronological timeline as provided by </span><a href='https://apps.apple.com/us/app/musicharbor/id1440405750'><strong><span>MusicHarbor</span></strong></a><span> - an app for iOS and MacOS that acts as a frontend for one’s music library across both Apple Music and Spotify. </span></p><p><span>It&#39;s hard to remember how we (Apple Music) got here without embarking upon some gargantuan </span><em><span>A Complete Visual History of Apple Music</span></em><span>-like document, but it must be said that Tim Cook&#39;s &quot;next chapter in music&quot; has become a sad afterthought. As far as I understand it, the &quot;streaming war&quot; between Apple and Spotify has long since gone definitively to the latter in statistical terms, which I&#39;d suggest to be an overall positive outcome for Apple Music subscribers, generally. The self-perception within the heavy music consumer crowd of &quot;niche,&quot; &quot;underground,&quot; &quot;obscure&quot; cultural minority should - in theory - push those who believe themselves </span><em><span>destined to be different</span></em><span> away from Spotify into the handy care of Apple, the absolute champion of this particular self-deception. To be honest - though I write this for </span><em><span>all</span></em><span> listeners, sincerely - I have found myself in a sort of utopian echo chamber of my own design in music culture terms. My days of waiting through 4+ hours of local openers before rap shows are far behind me, and I consume and engage exclusively with music I find personally redeemable. </span></p><p><span>My Apple Music library has become quite fragmented after I lost my entire physical music collection along with the external drives containing my accumulated digital music library in 2017. Still, after more or less starting anew this past December and casually, deliberately adding digital files back into the accursed, ancient iTunes desktop application and restoring some (outdated) versions of my handful of shared curatorial playlists thanks to SongShift (which we&#39;ll glance on later,) MusicHarbor currently lists 1433 artists represented across my Apple Music and (very sparse) Spotify libraries. I know this because of </span><a href='https://routinehub.co/shortcut/8935/'><span>a very simple Siri Shortcut</span></a><span> I modified which returns a text list of all Artists in one&#39;s MusicHarbor library in Quick Look. (</span><a href='https://gist.github.com/extratone/32763d8d2d6a71ab0fe4e045a6fb4441'><span>Here is my result</span></a><span> as of this moment in GitHub Gist form.) According my App Store receipts, I first downloaded MusicHarbor on March 26 - 20 days ago - which is mentionable because of how much I&#39;ve accomplished with very minimal time investment in terms of curating my own music library thanks to MusicHarbor. As you&#39;ll note in the 3rd of the 4 screenshots embedded above, I was able to delete System of a Down from my library - a single function which alone justifies the app&#39;s one-time $5.99 &quot;Unlock Everything&quot; fee, to my sensibility. I&#39;ve also been able to begin following all the artists represented in a few of my favorite playlists with a handful of taps - a task which would literally require hours in the native Apple Music app of old (when one could actually follow artists, there.) On that note, it&#39;s time to cite the primary </span><em><span>MacStories</span></em><span> article you should read, entitled &quot;</span><a href='https://www.macstories.net/ios/how-i-keep-track-of-new-music-releases/'><span>How I Keep Track of New Music Releases</span></a><span>,&quot; regarding Apple Music&#39;s performance as a release tracker:</span></p><blockquote><p><span>The ‘New Releases’ section is tucked at the very end of the For You page and laid out as a horizontal carousel that requires a lot of swiping; you can view the ‘New Releases’ page as a grid, which has sections for different weeks, but, in my experience, it only aggregates highlights for new releases from some of my favorite artists. The ‘New Music Mix’ playlist is not terrible, but it often comes loaded with stale data – songs I’ve already listened to multiple times and which shouldn’t qualify as “new” weeks after their original release date. Furthermore, I’ve found notifications for new releases for artists in my library unreliable at best: I occasionally get notifications for new albums, but never for new singles or EPs.</span></p></blockquote><p><span>Here, Federico Viticci is riffing off </span><a href='https://chorus.fm/features/liner-notes-november-1st-2019/'><span>a newsletter issue</span></a><span> written by music blogger Jason Tate, in which he describes the service&#39;s missing tracking functionality as &quot;the single most frustrating part of Apple Music.&quot; Though these points in the conversation are both almost two years old, MusicHarbor remains the ultimate means of tracking new music releases chronologically on Apple&#39;s platforms. Though I am personally just three weeks in, the confidence this app has given me in the certainty of its chronological release feed is quite profound. Its integration with one&#39;s calendar to track </span><em><span>upcoming</span></em><span> releases is a bit much for my own needs, but I know personally enough invested curators for whom it&#39;d be a godsend to mark it no small addition.</span></p><p><img src="https://i.snap.as/UxLBTYvL.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" alt="MusicHarbor on MacOS"></p><p><span>MusicHarbor’s only downside is entirely excusable/understandable, in context: it’s a bit clunky. For the sake of this work, I set up </span><a href='https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/musicharbor/pl.u-2aoq40vTaR0XmA'><span>a shared Apple Music playlist</span></a><span> so I could further demonstrate all the new music I discovered in MusicHarbor. Adding whole albums to this playlist with a single tap </span><em><span>feels</span></em><span> powerful because it </span><em><span>is</span></em><span> - I’ve no idea what sort of developer wizardry is involved in such an action, but the Wait Wheel doesn’t feel like too much to endure. Adding a release to one’s library - the other in-MusicHarbor accumulative function - is a bit quicker. It’s important to remember that this piece of software was/is created and maintained by a single human being, though I would expect nothing but improvement, going forward.</span></p><p><img src="https://i.snap.as/yN3nbcdR.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" alt="Adding to MusicHarbor Playlist"></p><p><span>That’s all I have to report on MusicHarbor, for the moment, but I’ll add further </span><em><span>MacStories</span></em><span> praise from their </span><a href='https://www.macstories.net/stories/macstories-selects-2019-recognizing-the-best-apps-of-the-year/#app-of-the-year-runner-up'><span>2019 MacStories Selects</span></a><span> app rewards:</span></p><blockquote><p><span>What makes MusicHarbor special – and, ultimately, the reason why we all use the app here at MacStories – is just how much developer Tanaka understands what someone who wants to know about new music releases is looking for.</span></p></blockquote><p><strong><span>July 2021 Update</span></strong><span>: The MacStories gentlemen have just published </span><a href='https://appstories.net/episodes/230'><span>an interview episode of </span><em><span>AppStories</span></em></a><span> speaking at length with MusicHabor creator Marcos Tanaka.</span></p><p><img src="https://i.snap.as/KylIYzaI.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" alt="Albums for iOS"></p><h3 id='albums'><a href='https://apps.apple.com/us/app/albums-album-focused-player/id1469948986'><span>Albums</span></a></h3><p><span>On the other end of the spectrum, exploring new digital manifestations of </span><em><span>The Music Collection</span></em><span>, is </span><a href='https://apps.apple.com/us/app/albums-album-focused-player/id1469948986'><span>Albums</span></a><span>, which actually functions as an entire replacement frontend player for Apple Music.

All I can say, really, is that I see an extremely powerful application, here, for a fairly specific use case: someone who’s listening is largely occupied by albums they already “own” in Apple Music and treasure deeply. The ability to set an individual record’s “Immersive UI Tint” down to the hex (in “Album Settings”) is as in-depth a tool of adoration as I’ve ever seen in a digital music service. Combined with Albums’ presumptuous takeover of actual playback from the Apple Music app, I think I can rightfully say that it was built for the </span><em><span>extremely serious</span></em><span> music consumer.</span></p><p><span>My favorite part so far: the app knew well enough to offer me THE ZRO BUTTON.

It’s not that MusicBot isn’t massively impressive and still useful, but it represents a class of super/hyper-Shortcuts which (from my perspective) </span><em><span>far</span></em><span>-overreach beyond the intended use case for Siri Shortcuts and end up immediately bewildering/alienating potential new users. Truthfully - as Federico singularly acknowledges - they are full </span><em><span>applications</span></em><span> built atop a less-than-ideal platform designed for relatively simple, </span><em><span>repeatable</span></em><span> automations. I’ll spare you further opining on this idea until another, potential Post, and instead demonstrate my personal solution.</span></p><p><a href='https://imgur.com/gallery/eblzlbD' target='_blank' class='url'>https://imgur.com/gallery/eblzlbD</a></p><p><span>In the clip above, you can see I was working on this very draft when LoneMoon’s “</span><a href='https://song.link/i/1554970332'><span>kawAii @F</span></a><span>” started playing.

Since the advent of widgets in iOS’ </span><a href='https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/add-widgets-to-the-home-screen-iphb8f1bf206/ios'><span>Today View</span></a><span>, I’ve also kept a button for this Shortcut in one of four precious slots in a box at the very top.

I added my own inquiry to </span><a href='https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/124512?answerId=671299022#671299022'><span>this post on the official Developer forums</span></a><span> asking about it, but don’t really expect anything back. According to “</span><a href='https://www.dxomark.com/what-is-audio-zoom-for-smartphones/'><span>What is Audio Zoom for smartphones</span></a><span>?” published on the site </span><em><span>DxOMark</span></em><span>:</span></p><blockquote><p><span>The main technology behind audio zoom is called beamforming, or spatial filtering. It allows changing an audio recording’s directivity (that is, the sensitivity according to the direction of the sound source) and shape it in any way necessary. In this case, the optimal directivity is a hypercardioid pattern (see illustration below), which enhances sounds coming from the front direction — that is, from the direction in which your camera is pointed — while attenuating sounds from all other directions (your background noise).</span></p></blockquote><p><span>My testing has suggested that </span><strong><span>the best means of recording unfiltered-as-possible stereo audio with an iPhone is to record video at 1x zoom with the native Camera app</span></strong><span> and extract the audio from the video file. In the </span><a href='https://davidblue.bandcamp.com/track/-'><span>Bandcamp track embedded below</span></a><span>, I “mounted” my 12 Pro Max right above my old upright’s soundboard and extracted audio directly from the video file with Audacity. It was then amplified slightly, saved to a FLAC file and uploaded directly to Bandcamp. Of course, it’s worth qualifying that - while I have extensive experience with audio - I have neither professional training, nor any professional monitoring equipment. </span></p><p><a href='https://davidblue.bandcamp.com/track/-' target='_blank' class='url'>https://davidblue.bandcamp.com/track/-</a></p><p><span>That said, the biggest objection I’ve heard from audiophiles regarding audio capture and manipulation on handsets, generally, has to do with their hardware’s extremely limited capabilities when compared to any sort of professional desktop soundcard. Given the greater argument I&#39;ve come to regarding the state of consumer tech as best exemplified by smartphone design - that we&#39;ve come to expect </span><em><span>far</span></em><span> too much of single devices, and the resulting jack-of-all-tradeness summing their real-life capabilities has become a </span><strong><span>severe detriment</span></strong><span> instead of a feature - I must echo, again, that adding &quot;studio&quot; audio capture, manipulation, and production capabilities to our </span><em><span>goddamned cellular phones</span></em><span> doesn&#39;t help anyone.

Regardless of the revenue-related controversies of late, Apple have simply become terrible stewards of the App Store in every imaginable sense. Scams and blatant intellectual property theft abound, while the majority of the most innovative entries I&#39;ve ever seen remain entirely obfuscated and uncelebrated by all of Apple.

I’ve exhaustively explored different means of convincing my own longtime Twitter friends to move, over that time, with very little success. Eugen, himself, published an </span><a href='https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2021/02/developing-an-official-ios-app-for-mastodon/'><span>official blog post</span></a><span> at the beginning of February detailing his plans to open up onboarding by way of “an official Mastodon app that is free to download and that is specialized in helping new users get started on the platform.” As a Patreon supporter of </span><a href='https://www.patreon.com/mastodon'><span>The Mastodon Project</span></a><span> (full disclosure,) I&#39;ve been testing this app (see preview shots at the very end,) and am quite smitten with it. That said, I thought it might be worth going over the third-party options iOS users currently have available to them, largely because the offerings are each innovative and mature applications in their own right. (Also, it’s become quite apparent that the normal tech media sources you’d go to for such a guide aren’t going to give Mastodon the attention it deserves.)</span></p><p><img src="https://i.snap.as/Y624NGHM.jpg" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" alt="Masto Mascot iOS Art"></p><h2 id='obligatory-context'><span>Obligatory(?) Context</span></h2><p><span>I originally intended to be as clinical as possible in this Post, having realized its potential as the singular comparison of its kind to appear in search results for new and potential users of Mastodon. From my perspective, Mastodon has long since surpassed regard as a novel social media experiment who&#39;s function is to prompt academic conversations about decentralization, open source, ad tech, and federated social&#39;s solutions to all of the Big Web&#39;s Big Boy (proprietary) Problems (though I have been compelled to </span><a href='https://github.com/extratone/bigblue'><span>invest significantly</span></a><span> in that very conversation.) In the less intellectual hours of my day-to-day life (read: most of the time,) Mastodon is nothing more or less than my favorite place on the internet. It is a relentless delight which I only lament because I want to share so much of it with my friends, but have continued to fail in my efforts to articulate that </span><strong><span>Mastodon is not a compromise; it is a better social space</span></strong><span>.</span></p><p><span>If you didn&#39;t know, this seems to have become </span><em><span>my general shit</span></em><span>, for lack of a better term: the ethical considerations of open source/&quot;alternative&quot; software are very important, yes! ... but they are </span><em><span>far</span></em><span> from the whole, and they are not a requisite for new users. The second of </span><a href='https://bilge.world/about'><span>this World Wide Web Blog&#39;s fundamental considerations</span></a><span>, in fact:</span></p><blockquote><p><span>The Open Source/Open Web community continues to struggle with their </span><em><span>brand image</span></em><span> (if you will) in both old and new ways that needlessly alienate (and sometimes obfuscate) some of their most important contributions from the average user. </span><strong><span>Technology media has failed in their responsibility to address this issue.</span></strong></p></blockquote><p><span>The blog on which you&#39;re reading this, in fact, is federated on </span><a href='https://activitypub.rocks/'><span>ActivityPub</span></a><span>. If you so chose, you could be reading it in any client capable of displaying large bodies of text. The crucial point, though, is that </span><em><span>you didn&#39;t need to know that</span></em><span> - you could very well go on reading it on the web in total ignorance/apathy regarding Federation.</span></p><p><em><span>Oh boy, here we go...</span></em><span> No. I did not want to say anything ideological - I wanted this Post to function as little more than a pretty screenshot showcase and simple associative list responding to all of the Reddit posts I&#39;ve seen to the tune of &quot;is there an iPhone app?&quot; As I explored them, however, I was reminded of the sheer creativity the &quot;alternative&quot; software community is capable of. Even the roughest of these considered apps seem unable to be faceless - sorting through the obscene amount of (unlabeled) screenshots accumulated over the past weeks of testing in my Recents folder has been </span><em><span>so</span></em><span> much easier than I thought it would be because of their relentless originality. If you&#39;ve actually used any iOS applications and/or browsed the singular App Store from which they can be acquired in the past 3-4 years, you&#39;re undoubtedly skeptical: what we might have called &quot;feature overlap&quot;  at one time has become all but the platform&#39;s core ethos. If you&#39;re the sort who enjoys screwing around with apps, generally, as I have for the whole of iPhone history, you have grown accustomed to disappointment.</span></p><p><a href='https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1402057069927309318' target='_blank' class='url'>https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1402057069927309318</a></p><p><span>Regardless of who is to blame, we can all agree that the App Store is currently oversaturated nigh </span><em><span>beyond usability</span></em><span> with mediocre entries built from the beginning with zero apparent ambition toward original function.

It was astonishing to find all but one or two of these apps </span><em><span>in a functional state</span></em><span>, actually. In all my equivalent experiences downloading the entirety of a given service&#39;s API-supported palette (e.g. IRC apps, </span><a href='https://www.vice.com/en/article/pkbgvg/major-internet-projects-are-leaving-freenode-after-korean-prince-takeover'><span>topically</span></a><span>,) an all-too-significant purpose of whatever ends up getting published is simply documenting the ~20% of available titles that </span><em><span>actually work</span></em><span> at the given moment. (I&#39;d have mentioned the &quot;best [service/task] iPhone apps for [year]&quot; listicles found in online publications like </span><em><span>Digital Trends</span></em><span> were it not for the percentage of them in which it&#39;s clear the author </span><em><span>did not actually download</span></em><span> some/most of the apps listed‽‽‽) Perhaps due to </span><a href='https://www.wsj.com/video/series/joanna-stern-personal-technology/apple-software-chief-explains-ios-145-defends-companys-reach-exclusive/57D138E3-3677-4A78-9534-62DAD443FE97'><span>iOS 14.5&#39;s implementation of ATT</span></a><span>, all of the Mastodon apps I could find and test (not counting non-English language-supporting apps, in fairness&#39; interest) are currently functioning.</span></p><p><span>So, if there&#39;s virtually zero chance a new Mastodon user might download one of the apps we&#39;re about to consider and find it broken, what practical function remains for this guide?

It’s held a place in my phone’s dock since the day I first downloaded it, for this and many other reasons. While one might find bugs/loose ends (understandably) exploring the functions of other indie social clients, within Toot!, they will only find little delights, like </span><a href='https://imgur.com/gallery/xAXs95J'><span>its wholly unique Share Sheet interface</span></a><span>.</span></p><p><img src="https://i.snap.as/bXG5SAUv.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" alt="Toot!

I vaguely understand what it means, and I do agree, but it&#39;s worth noting that I speak with some privilege, having compared all of these apps on the top performing handset Apple currently has to offer. In many ways, it is the most frugal of the new offerings, especially, yet it strikes a keen balance between function and delight. I think &quot;native&quot; can be translated as </span><em><span>generally of a stout, sturdy disposition</span></em><span>, thanks to the care put into honing said balance. </span></p><h2 id='less-than-sanctioned'><span>Less-Than-Sanctioned</span></h2><p><img src="https://i.snap.as/S6VkSlY0.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" alt="Tootle for iOS"></p><h3 id='tootle'><a href='https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tootle-for-mastodon/id1236013466'><span>Tootle</span></a></h3><p><span>I&#39;m not entirely positive which Mastodon app was </span><em><span>actually</span></em><span> the first on my iPhone, back in 2017, but I know for sure it was either Amaroq or the dearest, infinitely-colorful Tootle.

Play around with it as I remember doing, all those years ago, and you&#39;d be surprised how hard it is to create an unusable color theme. What I find </span><em><span>most</span></em><span> shame in, though, is that Tootle appears to be completely invisible in regular app store searches, now.

I noticed fairly quickly that the iOS app was a re-branded release of what used to be Mast. My first instinct upon this discovery was to DM Mast&#39;s original developer, </span><a href='https://twitter.com/JPEGuin'><span>Shihab Meboob</span></a><span>, on Twitter, but frankly, I&#39;ve already bothered him enough there over the years, so it&#39;s understandable that I didn&#39;t hear back. When I downloaded the desktop app I found on </span><a href='https://www.roma.rocks/#desktop'><span>Roma&#39;s web page</span></a><span> and noticed its similarity to </span><a href='https://whalebird.social/en/desktop/contents'><span>Whalebird</span></a><span>, I decided to use the site&#39;s contact form to </span><a href='https://github.com/extratone/bilge/blob/main/correspondence/Roma%20Inquiry.md'><span>inquire</span></a><span> about what exactly was going on as gingerly as I could. Happily, I received a reply just </span><em><span>minutes</span></em><span> later from Leo Radvinsky, head of </span><a href='https://leo.com/'><span>Leo.com</span></a><span>, &quot;a Florida-based boutique venture capital fund that invests in technology companies:&quot;</span></p><blockquote><p><span>Hi David, </span></p><p><span>In both cases we funded the original developers of both Mast and Whalebird to create a branded whitelabel app specially made for Pleroma. The idea was to make Roma a cross platform brand/app. It didn&#39;t really work out so now we&#39;re working on a new app from scratch called Fedi for iOS and Android and releasing that as open source. </span></p><p><a href='https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fediverse.app&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US' target='_blank' class='url'>https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fediverse.app&hl=en_US&gl=US</a><span> </span></p><p><a href='https://apps.apple.com/in/app/fedi-for-pleroma-and-mastodon/id1478806281' target='_blank' class='url'>https://apps.apple.com/in/app/fedi-for-pleroma-and-mastodon/id1478806281</a><span> </span></p><p><span>I think Roma has been removed from the app stores as it&#39;s no longer supported. </span></p><p><span>Let me know if you have any other questions</span></p></blockquote><p><span>Though my hopes for the original Mast to live on in Roma form were more or less dashed by this message, the suggestion that someone is investing </span><strong><span>actual capital</span></strong><span> into federated social is certainly worth celebrating. If Roma is still available on the App Store as you&#39;re reading this, I insist you download it immediately.

Hopefully, my relative lack of experience with </span><a href='https://pleroma.social/'><span>Pleroma</span></a><span> - another ActivityPub-based, federated social network - won&#39;t let you down, here. After a brief shock from the uniqueness of Fedi&#39;s UI passes, one immediately notices how beautifully it is animated, wholly disregarding my </span><a href='https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1357394407201398791'><span>recently-acquired</span></a><span> preference for as little animation as possible. Perhaps more than any other app discussed here, Fedi feels uncannily bespoke in a way which iOS apps almost never do. It is undoubtedly the result of a very specific vision - to disregard the whole modern template for social apps and completely reimagine the archetype. Personally, I&#39;m not sure if it would be easy to get used to, but my tastes/habits in this regard are very much the result of the past decade of proprietary social apps&#39; blandness. Going forward with substantial financial backing and the talents of whoever it was that got it this far, no doubt we should all have very high hopes for Fedi.</span></p><p><img src="https://i.snap.as/Kt8ZbQFk.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" alt="DUDU (嘟嘟) for iOS"></p><h3 id='dudu-嘟嘟'><a href='https://bit.ly/duduios'><span>DUDU (嘟嘟)</span></a><span> </span></h3><p><span>DUDU (or &quot;嘟嘟,&quot; which translates to &quot;Toot,&quot; appropriately,) definitely wins for </span><em><span>Cutest Iconography</span></em><span>.

While it’s probably the least polished of the lot - and therefore likely the least viable candidate for the role of your primary, daily-driven Mastodon client - is is far from a throwaway application. Some evil component of Takeyasu’s mind was clearly let loose if only for a moment, for Oyakodon’s Facebook-style theme is reminiscent enough of Big Blue to alarm. The volume of its design definitely peaks in its Cute theme, which is so violently loud I could not help but extract its color palette to illustrate just how furious its creator must have been.</span></p><p><img src="https://i.snap.as/AFbihGYF.jpeg" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" alt="Oyakodon Cute Theme Palette"></p><p><span>Truly diabolical design, there.

If I’m not mistaken, it holds a special personal accolade as the only iOS app which has caused me to involuntarily shriek. This might sound like an insult, but it is actually the peak of my praise. I believe my knowledge of iOS development safely allows me to suppose that StarPterano was built with complete disregard for any established UI element libraries. That is, the familiar toggles and buttons developers rely on to standardize the iOS experience were cast aside entirely in favor of handbuilt, translucent buttons of a sort of neon quality which call menus and text entry fields no less alien to the platform. The most astonishing bit, though, is that it </span><em><span>works</span></em><span>. On my 12 Pro Max, it’s exceptionally smooth, in fact.</span></p><audio controls="">

He notes that decentralized platforms have universally rejected algorithmic recommendation if for any other reason than “without centralized computing power, such [a] recommendation service is also not that feasible.” “Adapting” back to a linear timeline in a manner which still encourages exploration was clearly a major design consideration for tooot.</span></p><blockquote><p><span>The core consists of 3 needs: 1) what I can read; 2) what I can write; 3) what I have done.</span></p></blockquote><p><span>Obviously, I very much appreciate Zhiyuan writing publicly about his thoughts on decentralized social and sharing specific considerations in his app’s design and look forward to continued updates.</span></p><h2 id='get-bent-big-social'><span>Get Bent, Big Social</span></h2><p><span>A few universal truths among these apps stand out as obligatory mentions. First - in comparison with their Proprietary, Big Social counterparts - they are all </span><em><span>ridiculously</span></em><span> </span><strong><span>frugal</span></strong><span>. Not a one weighs over 40mb, while minor (unexplained) updates to the official Twitter app </span><a href='https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1393294957352468494'><span>often exceed 100mb</span></a><span>. They are all astonishingly </span><strong><span>robust</span></strong><span> - I did not experience a single crash in the course of normal testing these &quot;alt&quot; social apps- even from the beta builds - while I distinctly remember the official Twitter app crashing several times over this period, even after I deleted and reinstalled it (an accepted maintenance requirement for anyone using it heavily for its entire history.) Also, on the topic of the platform, itself, they are also made absurdly </span><strong><span>interoperable</span></strong><span> by the ActivityPub standard. My </span><a href='https://pixelfed.social/DavidBlue'><span>PixelFed</span></a><span> posts show up seamlessly on their timelines among content from </span><a href='https://diasp.org/'><span>Diaspora</span></a><span>, </span><a href='https://pleroma.social/'><span>Pleroma</span></a><span>, and Mastodon, itself. </span></p><p><a href='https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1393294957352468494' target='_blank' class='url'>https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1393294957352468494</a></p><p><span>The overwhelming impression I was left with after testing these apps was one of unwavering competence, cleverness, and true innovation. How many different ways can I possibly conjure forth in order to communicate this? I, David Blue - the vain fucker with a precollection for the most superficial variables of software design </span><em><span>so</span></em><span> healthy that I have on multiple occasions designed whole, years-long workflows around specific applications </span><em><span>entirely because of their available color palettes</span></em><span>... </span><strong><span>It is I who requires you to take a good fucking look</span></strong><span>, because this list of decentralized, largely open source, federated social software is a goddamned fashion show.</span></p><h2 id='continuing-to-explore-social-ownership'><span>Continuing to Explore Social Ownership</span></h2><p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/122717470-43f08a00-d231-11eb-890f-dfa3ff33b65d.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" alt="Mastodon Account Wordcloud"></p><p><span>This couldn&#39;t be &quot;just&quot; an app guide - I think I have thoroughly accepted this, by now, just in time for some conclusionary remarks. Somehow, the subject I originally tackled specifically because I thought it would be quick, rudimentary, and straightforward has become yet another personal journey. It&#39;d feel a bit preposterous to declare any one of these apps to be </span><em><span>life-changing</span></em><span>, but - in every sense of the term, in contemporary, inevitably social media-informed life, they do indeed constitute a form of radical, ideological wellness. Each of them managed to remind me of a different minute delight found within a developer-user dynamic made up of thoughtful and effective minds working to contribute original and valuable experiences, first. Most noteworthy of these little freedoms: the realization that the upcoming &quot;official&quot; Mastodon app along with any future new options are exclusively a positive thing </span><em><span>for the user</span></em><span>... None of these apps were conceived to gobble up market share because the market is fundamentally, inevitably, uncompromisingly </span><em><span>infinitely shared</span></em><span>. I don&#39;t know anything about business, but I </span><em><span>do</span></em><span> know that relief from the burden of considering proprietary multivectored development intentions has been personally breathtaking. I can only hope the reciprocal compensation is happening at even a fraction of what it &quot;should&quot; be. </span></p><p><span>From another essential direction, I hope I have communicated that they&#39;re far from curious, &quot;niche&quot; or vanity side projects, now. When I used the term &quot;mature&quot; in introducing this little arena, I very much meant it - these &quot;alt&quot; social clients developed almost exclusively within single-person-led projects now make the Twitter for iOS app look ugly </span><em><span>and</span></em><span> fucking broken. &quot;Giving social networking back to you&quot; has never been more resonant. Yes, it really is Toot!&#39;s &quot;take a break&quot; blue screen, Amaroq&#39;s mysterious Awoo mode toggle, iMast&#39;s music app integration, Mercury&#39;s configurable timelines, Metatext&#39;s native solidity, Tootle&#39;s custom colors, Tusker&#39;s Digital Wellness controls, DUDU&#39;s elemental readability, Roma&#39;s quiet resurrection of Mast&#39;s UI bravado, Stella&#39;s utterly bizarre visual departures, Fedi&#39;s odd animated UI behaviors, Tootoise&#39;s consideration of </span><em><span>pace</span></em><span>, B4X&#39;s unfathomable elements, Ore2&#39;s parallel timelines, tooot&#39;s development story, and Oyakodon&#39;s adorable rough edges that have made my online life </span><em><span>measurably</span></em><span>... </span><em><span>immensely</span></em><span> better, these past weeks.

Essentially, Mastodon Commander-in-Chief Eugen Rochko and his team developed a whole, exceptional iOS app in the span of time it took me to write the </span><a href='https://bilge.world/mastodon-ios-apps'><span>third-party Mastodon iOS app showcase</span></a><span> just before this item in </span><em><span>The Psalms</span></em><span>’ feed. If you’re new to this conversation, perhaps it’d be best to start in February of this year, with </span><a href='https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2021/02/developing-an-official-ios-app-for-mastodon/'><span>Eugen’s announcement of the “official” Mastodon app’s development</span></a><span> on the official Mastodon blog. “We need an official Mastodon app that is free to download and that is specialized in helping new users get started on the platform,” argues Eugen, in response to feedback indicating “the lack of an app that carries </span><span>[</span><span>Mastodon’s</span><span>]</span><span> name in the app stores trips up newcomers.” My first thought regarding the idea of an app </span><em><span>Specialized</span></em><span> in onboarding cynically jumped to the assumption that such a design choice would result in a less-than-ideal experience for those of us who already call Mastodon our home. However, as a </span><a href='https://patreon.com/mastodon'><span>Patreon</span></a><span> supporter of the Mastodon Project, I’ve had the privilege of testing the final result for the past five weeks, and I can tell ya… It is so much more than that.</span></p><p><a href='https://youtube.com/watch?v=bD8GQvNrE7E' target='_blank' class='url'>https://youtube.com/watch?v=bD8GQvNrE7E</a></p><h2 id='onboarding'><span>Onboarding</span></h2><p><span>I’d like to offer the </span><a href='https://youtu.be/bD8GQvNrE7E'><span>demo video</span></a><span> embedded above as an unusually succinct (from me) demonstration of the delightfully well-considered onboarding process. I would go so far as to declare it </span><strong><span>the best all-around social network onboarding process currently available</span></strong><span>. Having very recently slugged through the official Twitter app’s equivalent, the frames greeting new Mastodon users within this app are unbelievably exceptional.</span></p><p><img src="https://i.snap.as/P5oxTAg9.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" alt="Onboarding in Mastodon for iOS"></p><p><span>First, we’re presented with a list of Mastodon instances (servers,) organized by category. Those friends of mine to whom I’ve failed to “sell” Mastodon have cited server selection as a major obstacle of confusion and I can’t imagine a better means of addressing it than the tool offered by this app. It’s beautiful and fast in a way previous utilities - like </span><a href='https://instances.social'><span>instances.social</span></a><span> - cannot be, especially for those most lacking in attention. Once we’ve chosen a server, we are immediately presented up front with a clearly readable document containing the “ground rules” set by its administrators. In my experience, these rules tend to be notably </span><strong><span>easy-to-understand</span></strong><span> and </span><strong><span>not open to interpretation</span></strong><span>, as if they were written primarily in the interest of community wellness rather than to construct a defense from legal action.</span></p><p><span>After we’ve agreed to the relevant terms of the server we’ve chosen, it’s on to account creation, which offers the options to which citizens of the social web have become accustomed - profile picture, username, email address, and password - but notably without the </span><a href='https://gimletmedia.com/shows/reply-all/n8hxzr7/176-twicarus'><span>inexplicable errors</span></a><span> exhibited for years in Big Social’s equivalent functions. Immediately following this frame, we are prompted to check our inboxes for a confirmation link. The explanation for my dramatic exclamation in the demo video comes down to Mastodon for iOS’ implementation of the operating system&#39;s intra-app linking function (with the syntax </span><code>mastodon://</code><span>,) which (in my experience) is hardly ever utilized correctly. The result is that I was able to click the incoming confirmation link within Outlook for iOS and then proceed </span><em><span>within the Mastodon app</span></em><span> instead of being bounced off to a web browser. This integration should not be remarkable, but - in the context of iOS development as it stands in 2021 - it most certainly is.</span></p><p><span>After confirmation, we are offered the option to explore the app’s “Find people to follow” function, which is informed by &quot;a mix of most followed accounts and most-engaged-with accounts from recent times that post primarily in your language,&quot; as </span><a href='https://mastodon.social/@Gargron/106674282886448440'><span>Eugen explained</span></a><span> in response to an earlier draft of this post. Indeed, the remarkably relevant results offered to me in the demo were not actually remarkable at all: I just know a lot of folks on mastodon.online - especially those who post the most. That&#39;s the whole bit! If you need &quot;proof,&quot; </span><a href='https://mastodon.online/@keys'><span>here is the finished result</span></a><span>, but obviously, I would advise you download the app and try yourself. (It&#39;s a cliché, yes, but seriously... What do you have to lose?)</span></p><p><img src="https://i.snap.as/F21Jm29Q.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" alt="Trending &amp; Profile Editing in Mastodon for iOS"></p><!--more--><h2 id='advantages'><span>Advantages</span></h2><p><span>One of the distinctly missing functions among the breadth of third-party offerings has been the ability to edit one&#39;s profile information from within the app. Mastodon for iOS addresses this in a particularly visually impressive way (see image embedded above.) Some also have yet to be updated with support for Polls, which the new app encompasses in a manner that puts Big Social&#39;s equivalents to shame. The ability to vertically drag individual options in the compose interface, for instance, reflects insight only gained by </span><em><span>actually using these features</span></em><span>. The result is definitively the best means of crafting a Mastodon poll, for what that&#39;s worth.</span></p><p><img src="https://i.snap.as/NKHk8e1W.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" alt="Polling in Mastodon for iOS"></p><h3 id='shortcuts'><span>Shortcuts</span></h3><p><span>As of this writing, Mastodon for  iOS also includes Siri Shortcut support by way of a single action, entitled &quot;Post on Mastodon.&quot; Mostly in the interest of demonstration, I have created and published two Shortcuts around this action on RoutineHub:</span></p><ol start='' ><li><span>&quot;</span><strong><a href='https://routinehub.co/shortcut/9776/'><span>Mastodon Share</span></a></strong><span>&quot; - a text-only Shortcut meant for the Share Sheet.</span></li><li><span>&quot;</span><strong><a href='https://routinehub.co/shortcut/9781/'><span>Mastgur</span></a></strong><span>&quot; - a more complicated Shortcut utilizing Imgur actions to get around the current Mastodon for iOS action&#39;s lack of multimedia support.</span></li></ol><p><img src="https://i.snap.as/H212I22P.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" alt="Siri Shortcuts for Mastodon for iOS"></p><p><span>Mastodon friend Emma&#39;s </span><a href='https://mstdn.cloud.themaymeow.com/@emma/106656610574981709'><span>customization of the latter</span></a><span> is a great example of how quickly one can tailor these (and all other) Siri Shortcuts to their own particular use.</span></p><h2 id='challenges'><span>Challenges</span></h2><p><span>As of this writing, coverage of the app’s release amounted only to </span><a href='https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/30/22602275/mastodon-decentralized-social-network-official-ios-app-launches'><span>a single news item from </span></a><em><a href='https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/30/22602275/mastodon-decentralized-social-network-official-ios-app-launches'><span>The Verge</span></a></em><a href='https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/30/22602275/mastodon-decentralized-social-network-official-ios-app-launches'><span>’s Adi Robinson</span></a><span>, which notes the omission of local/federated “firehose” timeline views out of a desire to “reduce the potential for conflict with Apple.” (see: the Inc.’s </span><a href='https://litchie.com/2021/07/idos2-will-be-gone'><span>blatantly inconsistent enforcement</span></a><span> of its store policies in the past few months.) As a Mastodon user who </span><em><span>does</span></em><span> occasionally engage with my local and federated timelines, I find this decision reasonable considering the wellspring of third-party apps on iOS which </span><em><span>do</span></em><span> support said views and the app’s explicit focus on brand new, fragile users. My personal experience disagrees with Eugen’s description of these timelines as a suboptimal means of capital-D Discovery, however, considering I’ve found </span><span>~</span><span>70-80% of </span><a href='https://github.com/extratone/bilge/blob/main/curation/mastodonfollowing.csv'><span>the 600+ accounts I follow</span></a><span>, there. (Though it should be noted that I </span><em><span>do not</span></em><span> represent any majority in my social media-specific preferences or behavior.)</span></p><p><span>Though the onboarding process’ people to follow finder is pretty darn stellar, I worry that our hypothetical new user has a high chance of landing on a more-or-less empty timeline. (For many, I’m sure this would be a welcome relief, at least initially.) A well-limited Local timeline view, at least, might prove a valuable upcoming addition. Regardless, I am 100% positive these omissions from the </span><em><span>initial release</span></em><span> version of this iOS app do not constitute some new ideological opposition to the greater concept of Federation.</span></p><p><img src="https://i.snap.as/7UTf6Qyx.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" alt="Composition Details in Mastodon for iOS"></p><p><span>Naturally, a recurring complaint about the app is already surfacing in hashtag iOS on the Fediverse: </span><a href='https://mastodon.social/@wiredfire/106672087623244223'><span>no multiple account support</span></a><span>?! Perhaps you’ve already written me off as a mindless devotee, but - especially after exploring </span><a href='https://github.com/extratone/FediiOS'><span>the whole breadth of Mastodon apps available on iOS</span></a><span> (all of which support multiple accounts) - the significance of this omission as a target for gripes seems laughably minuscule. Considering I have yet to delete any of the 20 apps I tested, I personally feel </span><em><span>pretty well covered</span></em><span> when it comes to checking my (embarrassingly numerous) alt accounts. It’d be one thing if longtime users/powerusers were left wanting for available apps designed for us, but we have a more diverse, quality palette to choose from than any other social media protocol. To decry this app - which was explicitly designed from the very beginning for new users - for skipping a function offered by </span><em><span>more than a dozen alternatives</span></em><span> is patently absurd. If you’ve got multiple accounts you feel the need to check regularly, order them by frequency, authenticate all but number one in the free, dependable </span><a href='https://apps.apple.com/us/app/amaroq-for-mastodon/id1214116200'><span>Amaroq</span></a><span>, and save Mastodon’s new app for your main.</span></p><h2 id='delights'><span>Delights</span></h2><p><span>The “relentless originality” I spoke of in my </span><em><span>third-party</span></em><span> showcase is no less exemplified in this first-party Mastodon app. Its color palette is a welcome departure from Tootsuite’s (the mother web application,) while still remaining definitively recognizable. The artwork dispersed throughout the app is adorable, as you’ve seen, and its bespoke audio player is without a doubt my favorite of such devices.</span></p><p><img src="https://i.snap.as/IRzEOzXl.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" alt="Mastodon for iOS Audio Player"></p><p><span>Custom audio notifications especially stood out among those third-party apps, so the project-sourced app’s inclusion of the iconic Mastodon “boop” is yet another small inclusion that adds a surprising amount of substance to the whole experience.</span></p><!--more--><p><span>Though quite specific to myself and the few other iPhone users who regularly command our handsets with physical keyboards, the Mastodon app’s inclusion of </span><strong><span>Bluetooth keyboard shortcuts</span></strong><span> provoked a moment of true euphoria when I first discovered them. As per my ‘</span><em><a href='https://github.com/extrakeys'><span>iPhone and the Bluetooth Keyboard</span></a></em><span> project, I have bestowed upon Mastodon for iPhone semi-officially “our” Universal Clacker Award for its consideration of us “full keyboard-strapped cellular phone users.” (As of this writing, the award is just a “trophy.”)</span></p><p><img src="https://i.snap.as/H7NjCvd7.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" alt="Mastodon for iPhone - Universal Clacker Award"></p><h3 id='mastodon-for-ios-keyboard-shortcuts'><span>Mastodon for iOS Keyboard Shortcuts</span></h3><figure><table><thead><tr><th style='text-align:center;' ><span>Action</span></th><th style='text-align:center;' ><span>Key</span></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style='text-align:center;' ><span>Open Compose Window</span></td><td style='text-align:center;' ><span>⌘ + N</span></td></tr><tr><td style='text-align:center;' ><span>Send Toot</span></td><td style='text-align:center;' ><span>⌘ + Return</span></td></tr><tr><td style='text-align:center;' ><span>Home Timeline/Refresh Timeline</span></td><td style='text-align:center;' ><span>⌘ + 1</span></td></tr><tr><td style='text-align:center;' ><span>Explore Tab</span></td><td style='text-align:center;' ><span>⌘ + 2</span></td></tr><tr><td style='text-align:center;' ><span>Notifications</span></td><td style='text-align:center;' ><span>⌘ + 3</span></td></tr><tr><td style='text-align:center;' ><span>Favorites</span></td><td style='text-align:center;' ><span>⌘ + F</span></td></tr><tr><td style='text-align:center;' ><span>Settings</span></td><td style='text-align:center;' ><span>⌘ + ,</span></td></tr><tr><td style='text-align:center;' ><span>Next Toot</span></td><td style='text-align:center;' ><span>j</span></td></tr><tr><td style='text-align:center;' ><span>Previous Toot</span></td><td style='text-align:center;' ><span>k</span></td></tr><tr><td style='text-align:center;' ><span>Toot Details</span></td><td style='text-align:center;' ><span>l</span></td></tr><tr><td style='text-align:center;' ><span>Favorite</span></td><td style='text-align:center;' ><span>f</span></td></tr><tr><td style='text-align:center;' ><span>Boost</span></td><td style='text-align:center;' ><span>r</span></td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p><span>An important consideration to inform the perspective through which we analyze such an app, I’d argue, is that </span><strong><span>this app could have been very bad</span></strong><span>. Those who bewilderingly measure the success of social networking services/protocols by their profit growth viability, alone, may well suggest it </span><em><span>should</span></em><span> have been bad. Had it been just mediocre, half-assed, and/or full of bugs, I’m sure I would still have paused everything to write and publish this review. The reality, though, is nothing less than exceptional. Unlike some of the third-party examples I discussed, I would argue Mastodon for iPhone to be an “objectively” excellent piece of software in that I cannot imagine any one sort of iPhone user </span><em><span>not</span></em><span> finding it refreshing in some way.</span></p><!--more--><p><span>I would sincerely worry for the person who feels nothing at all from the artwork, the bespoke UI, or the general care exhibited in its craftsmanship, </span><em><span>but</span></em><span> they wouldn’t have exhausted reasons to use it. From the very first beta release I installed to the first release version pushed to the App Store just yesterday, the app has </span><em><span>never</span></em><span> crashed, and the single bug I encountered was documented and fixed before I had time to begin a feedback report. While Twitter’s official iOS app does include a few Siri Shortcuts actions, they are all made immediately useless by a universal command to open the app, itself. Remove the obsessive insistence that any/all functions only be performed with your app in focus - even when it surely makes no difference to your ad tech mechanism - and you have Mastodon’s single action, “Show When Run” toggle included.</span></p><p><span>I’m not sure what I expected from an “official” Mastodon app upon first reading that winter blog post, but what I’ve been delivered is quite a gem. Regardless of how its specific feature omissions may strike your ideological organ(s,) you cannot deny that great time and energy was invested in this app.</span></p><p><img src="https://i.snap.as/hqmcJQGx.jpg" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" alt="Mastodon for iOS QR Code"></p><h2 id='notable-hyperlinks'><span>Notable Hyperlinks</span></h2><ul><li><span>The newly-publicized </span><a href='https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon-ios'><span>GitHub Repository</span></a></li><li><span>The app’s </span><a href='https://www.producthunt.com/posts/mastodon-for-ios'><span>Product Hunt Page</span></a><span> (Congratulations on “#1 Product of the Day!”… I think?)</span></li><li><a href='https://www.patreon.com/mastodon'><span>The Mastodon Project Patreon page</span></a></li></ul><p><span>#software</span></p><p><span>==</span></p><h1 id='against-all-strategic-social'><span>Against All Strategic Social</span></h1><p><img src="https://i.snap.as/vopPn5mt.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" alt="lol Artifact"></p><h2 id='a-rushed-request-for-pause--reflection-on-why-we-use-social-media'><span>A rushed request for pause &amp; reflection on </span><em><span>why</span></em><span> we use social media.</span></h2><audio controls="">

I would love (for both selfish and very humanitarian reasons) to be able to proclaim some precious, one-of-a-kind genius as the sole differentiator between my complete confidence in my ability to design and maintain social software configurations that have kept my online consumption </span><em><span>entirely</span></em><span> free of unwanted encounters and the amount of regular involuntary bullshit I hear described in the day-to-day online existence of everyone around me. The truth, I suspect, involves my being of the most privileged category of human in Western civilization combined with the group of high school friends who adopted and socialized me. (A story for another permalink, certainly, if not my equivalent of </span><em><span>Trick Mirror</span></em><span>.)</span></p><p><span>~</span><span>~</span><span>More importantly, perhaps, I don&#39;t think I can recall a single instance of sincere malice from within myself toward anyone who&#39;d actually converse with me.

I finished the first and narrowest one - the aforelinked Tweetbot 6 review - but the (debatably) most important one - highlighting how irresponsibly and distastefully </span><a href='https://github.com/extratone/bilge/issues/79'><span>Twitter butchered Periscope and built Spaces atop its technology</span></a><span> - would make less and less sense as time goes on. I definitely got caught up in the &quot;death&quot; of the live video streaming service, fueled by my now quite old desire to celebrate it, which I will hopefully accomplish </span><em><span>eventually</span></em><span> in a very sentimental essay. If I can successfully link them editorially, the subject encompassing Spaces - social audio&#39;s &quot;moment&quot; - would also include mention of RSS, &quot;Podcasting&quot; (the term describing the medium,) Spotify, and Clubhouse, inevitably. Instead of counting on my future self entirely, however, I&#39;m going to begin by discussing that last one.</span></p><p><img src="https://i.snap.as/hf2fIH9M.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" alt="Clubhouse Blasted Logo"></p><h2 id='the-th-social-audio-renaissance'><span>The (‽‽‽th) Social Audio Renaissance</span></h2><p><span>Exactly one month ago, I finally </span><a href='https://www.joinclubhouse.com/@davidblue'><span>broke into Clubhouse</span></a><span> thanks to a random kind stranger on Twitter who preferred not to be named. April 25th was the first time I set eyes on the app - though I could&#39;ve (and usually would&#39;ve) looked up screenshots and/or browsed the litter of how tos available, I did not. By this time, I&#39;d accumulated quite a bit of experience with Twitter Spaces - derided universally by tech media as a &quot;Clubhouse clone&quot; - and therefore assumed the original would be &quot;better,&quot; at least in pure feature terms. What I found, however, was even </span><em><span>less</span></em><span> evidence that anyone building Clubhouse has been/is/intends to be a regular Clubhouse user. Spaces, at least, included five emoji reacts for listeners from the beginning:  💯✊✌️👋😂. Clubhouse&#39;s exclusive means of Listener-Host interaction is Hand Raising, which is essentially requesting to speak, even though the hand waving emoji is </span><em><a href='https://joinclubhouse.com/press'><span>literally featured in their logo</span></a></em><span>. (The fact that neither have thought to add 🙌 is absolutely inexcusable/inexplicable.)</span></p><p><a href='https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1344473573226762241' target='_blank' class='url'>https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1344473573226762241</a></p><p><span>In case you weren&#39;t aware, I appear to enjoy trying out new social services. My password manager is full of literally thousands of credentials for social media apps/services/startups - most of which have undoubtedly collapsed or been absorbed by a larger entity. Since generating said credentials has become such an easy process, especially, I tend to immediately sign up for an account on just about every one I hear about. (I even have </span><a href='https://parler.com/#/user/Extratone'><span>a Parler profile</span></a><span> I cannot bear to actually look at.) Generally, I sign up, follow anyone I know from elsewhere if given an account-bridging option, poke around enough to figure out whether or not the service in question could add something to my online existence, and end up leaving for good. Most of these services are </span><em><span>not</span></em><span> unique in any way, to a perplexing degree. A few - like Pinterest - gain success separately as I give up on trying to integrate them into my life. The miniscule remaining percentage, though, end up becoming a part of my daily existence. The most </span><em><span>recent</span></em><span> of these dates back to April 2017, when I first discovered </span><a href='https://bilge.world/eugen-rochko-interview'><span>Mastodon</span></a><span>.</span></p><p><a href='https://twitter.com/0kbps/status/1393792313936146433' target='_blank' class='url'>https://twitter.com/0kbps/status/1393792313936146433</a></p><h3 id='the-feature-story'><span>The Feature Story</span></h3><p><span>&quot;Social Audio&quot; did not begin with Clubhouse. Anchor originally launched as a &quot;</span><a href='http://web.archive.org/web/20160209224846/https://anchor.fm/about'><span>public radio</span></a><span>&quot; app, believe it or not. </span><em><span>Extratone</span></em><span>&#39;s channel was actually the </span><a href='https://www.patreon.com/posts/archived-our-day-11592398'><span>first to be featured</span></a><span> in their Music section, once upon a time. Frankly, that happening was the most positive outcome of my social media service accumulation habit. More recently, </span><a href='https://stereo.com/davidblue'><span>Stereo</span></a><span> launched, describing themselves as &quot;</span><a href='https://stereo.com/about'><span>the premier LIVE broadcast social platform that enables people to have and discover real conversations in real time</span></a><span>.&quot; Bizarrely, the most legitimate media coverage I could find of Stereo was </span><a href='https://www.glamourmagazine.co.uk/article/stereo-app'><span>from </span></a><em><a href='https://www.glamourmagazine.co.uk/article/stereo-app'><span>Glamour UK</span></a></em><span>, and its author definitely spent less than a day actually using the service. Adam Corolla remains #1 on its earnings leaderboard and its </span><a href='https://youtu.be/0GfGLUbc6fw'><span>conversation export feature</span></a><span> is a personal favorite.

From that context, I must say that Clubhouse is horribly unoriginal - not only in the sense that &quot;successful&quot; business implementations of others&#39;, previous ideas tend to be diluted versions of the original, but almost pitifully so. I will commend the app&#39;s developers on their somewhat-thorough release notes (even though they can be viewed only when first opening the app after an update instead of </span><em><span>in the designated space on the App Store</span></em><span>,) but the extent of </span><em><span>linkable</span></em><span> Clubhouse documentation amounts to </span><a href='https://joinclubhouse.com/blog'><span>eight blog posts</span></a><span> and a &quot;</span><a href='https://www.notion.so/Community-Guidelines-461a6860abda41649e17c34dc1dd4b5f'><span>Community Guidelines</span></a><span>&quot; Notion page. Though I&#39;ve only been a user for one month, I wonder what the fuck they&#39;ve been doing since launch, given how sparsely-featured the app is at this moment. There are Notifications, Profiles, and Clubs - the latter of which cannot be created until a user surpasses an unknown threshold of renown(?) on the app. Competent calendar integration may be the service&#39;s singular innovation, though support for Outlook has yet to be added. The Big Issue, though, is finding a &quot;talk&quot; to attend that will not drive you utterly insane...</span></p><p><img src="https://i.snap.as/RypjcP6M.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" alt="Clubhouse Bullshit"></p><h3 id='the-grand-delusion'><span>The Grand Delusion</span></h3><p><span>I wrote the assumptions at the beginning of this Post in a single go after </span><a href='https://twitter.com/neoyokel/status/1388930367671910404'><span>a particularly icky Sunday Clubhouse experience</span></a><span> out of a deep concern that&#39;d been growing since first exploring the app. The content I&#39;ve found there is not at all what I expected, to be honest. I&#39;ve found it almost entirely indecipherable, which makes critique beyond </span><a href='https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1388936080645312520'><span>just fucking screaming</span></a><span> difficult. </span><em><span>The New Yorker</span></em><span>&#39;s Anna Wiener did a much better job than I could realistically manage in &quot;</span><a href='https://www.newyorker.com/news/letter-from-silicon-valley/in-the-clubhouse'><span>Clubhouse Feels like a Party</span></a><span>:&quot;</span></p><blockquote><p><span>There was something pleasant about meandering from conversation to conversation, as if I had walked into my own home to find a conference in full swing.

None of my friends have ever Tweeted a Clubhouse link (determinable via </span><a href='https://twitter.com/search?q=%22joinclubhouse%22&amp;src=typed_query&amp;f=live&amp;pf=on'><span>this Twitter search</span></a><span>.)

This is noteworthy because I believe </span><a href='https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/following'><span>my list of followed accounts on Twitter</span></a><span> to be particularly diverse. I actively followed accounts across my various interests from ages 15-25 (when I hit my </span><a href='https://bit.ly/dbfollow'><span>follow limit</span></a><span>) and basically </span><em><span>never unfollowed anyone</span></em><span>. I would imagine there are several accounts within that list which I would be ashamed to be associated with, now, and yet none have shared a Clubhouse link. Reading any further into this observation would require actual data journalism, which I&#39;ll leave to the pros. It does prompt the question, though: if nobody I&#39;ve ever known or been interested in on Twitter is using Clubhouse, </span><em><span>who</span></em><span> in fuck </span><em><span>is</span></em><span>?</span></p><p><span>Frankly, I do not understand the business incentive behind the massive duplication of other software/services defining featuresets of late. I see that Instagram stories have eclipsed Snapchat&#39;s in terms of </span><a href='https://money.cnn.com/2018/06/28/technology/instagram-stories-users/index.html'><span>sheer user count</span></a><span>, but I do not understand why its leaders would choose to fuck their legacy by such blatant idea theft, much less why </span><a href='https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2020/introducing-fleets-new-way-to-join-the-conversation.html'><span>Twitter</span></a><span>, </span><a href='https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/28/facebook-launches-stories-in-the-main-facebook-app'><span>Facebook</span></a><span>, </span><a href='https://blog.patreon.com/lens/'><span>Patreon</span></a><span> and even fucking </span><a href='https://www.inputmag.com/culture/nobody-wants-stories-on-their-linkedin-feed'><span>LinkedIn</span></a><span> have implemented nearly-identical featuresets. Though I know Ben Thompson&#39;s word on these matters should be easily digestible, I haven&#39;t been able to actually take a bite. For the End User, especially, I cannot even begin to conceive of what the leaders behind these decisions imagine the day-to-day experience of the average social media user looks like in the near future. </span><em><span>How many apps</span></em><span> am I going to cycle through to get a single story-type piece of content satisfactorily shared? Personally, I currently use three, and sharing a single bit individually across all of them one-by-one (since the current state of APIs is not conducive to consumer-targeted mass-sharing tools) makes me feel utterly insane.</span></p><p><a href='https://youtube.com/watch?v=7uFR_bSxhTg' target='_blank' class='url'>https://youtube.com/watch?v=7uFR_bSxhTg</a></p><p><span>My lack of understanding would be meaningless if it were not so widely shared among my peers - young, brilliant, multifaceted, and distinctly original creators who (in large part) make stuff on the internet full-time. </span><em><span>They</span></em><span> are who I&#39;d actually plan ahead to hear from in a live broadcast setting like Clubhouse or Twitter Spaces, but Twitch seems to do just fine.

The potential of the term &quot;social audio&quot; is truly being explored by projects like </span><a href='https://www.patreon.com/RaveDJ'><span>Rave.DJ</span></a><span> - a homegrown, Patreon-funded service for sharing mixes/mashups.

As I may or may not get around to arguing thoroughly about Twitter Spaces, these services&#39; fundamental, near-complete disinterest in </span><strong><span>Discovery</span></strong><span> of new voices and their subsequent servitude to only their most popular users should be extremely worrying for us all - including those who benefit most.</span></p><p><img src="https://i.snap.as/DhF352N3.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" alt="Tinder Obfuscation"></p><h2 id='the-consequences-of-strategy'><span>The Consequences of Strategy</span></h2><p><span>I have more than my fair share of stories and peeves about dating apps.

(Why on Earth I am compelled to do so, nobody knows. Not even God.) Somehow, though, I think most of us can agree that Tinder is the </span><em><span>least shitty</span></em><span> of the explicitly hookup-ish spectrum of the genre.

I would explicitly discourage that particular sort of demonization, mostly because it has proven completely ineffective as cultural critique.) I am in no position to relevantly explore the topic of Society &amp; Sex, generally, other than to insist that most people on Tinder </span><em><span>in my area</span></em><span>, at least, are not looking to </span><em><span>leverage</span></em><span> it </span><em><span>for the dick</span></em><span>. They are looking for dates, and a good many are working class single mothers. To be clear, I’m not trying to suggest anyone in this demographic would be “fooled” by such a suggestion. Offended, perhaps, and/or activated in such a way that would lead to them replacing all of their profile’s pictures with photos of </span><em><span>just</span></em><span> their children.

For those of you currently running the latest iOS 15 Beta and those in the future running the full release, </span><strong><span>what follows is a guide on how you can use my own shortcuts and methods to generate, metadate, and embed Siri-powered audio text-to-speech files relatively quickly without having to use desktop-class (or any other) hardware</span></strong><span>.</span></p><p><img src="https://i.snap.as/P0yJJyUc.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" alt="TTS Shortcuts Compared"></p><p><span>To begin, you should install two brand new shortcuts of mine: </span><strong><a href='https://routinehub.co/shortcut/9953/'><span>Make Audio from Article Body</span></a></strong><span> and (if you intend to stick with me to the embed stage, anyway,) my </span><a href='https://routinehub.co/shortcut/9948/'><span>&lt; audio &gt; Embed Tool</span></a><span>. Both should function out of the box, but I would highly encourage that you try building your own shortcut around the </span><code>Make Spoken Audio From Text</code><span> action, even if you&#39;ve never worked with Shortcuts (or any sort of automation, for that matter) before, </span><em><span>especially</span></em><span> if you plan to be using Siri as a text-to-speech generator with any frequency.</span></p><p><a href='https://youtube.com/watch?v=5yZB7OC8Vgk' target='_blank' class='url'>https://youtube.com/watch?v=5yZB7OC8Vgk</a></p><h3 id='intended-result'><span>Intended Result</span></h3><p><span>Throughout this guide, I&#39;m going to be using </span><a href='https://bilge.world/johnny-tsunami-smart-house-slavery'><span>a five-year-old ramble of mine</span></a><span> about the oddly-perceptive bits found in early-oughts Disney movies as example text. Earlier today, I used my own personalized version of my new shortcut to generate an example of in which the process we&#39;re about to explore should result. The </span><span>~</span><span>6000 words of text took just over 3 minutes, 30 seconds to render consistently in three consecutive timed attempts. You can listen to it </span><a href='https://whyp.it/t/johnny-tsunami-vi-separate-but-equal-siri-voice-2-tts-74752'><span>on Whyp</span></a><span> and/or inspect </span><a href='https://github.com/extratone/bilge/raw/main/audio/TTS/JohnnyTsunami.m4a'><span>the actual file</span></a><span> yourself, if you&#39;d like.</span></p><p><img src="https://i.snap.as/dktmGQQb.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" alt="Plain Text Parsed by Safari"></p><h3 id='input-format'><span>Input Format</span></h3><p><span>If we were trying to do this using any other available method in 2021 - even the expensive ones - our first task would be scrubbing our subject text of any special formatting (Word,) symbols, embed, hyperlinks, and any other data Siri doesn&#39;t understand (roman numerals, for example.) As a Windows user who&#39;s not at all new to free ways to automate accessibility improvements to web content, I envy both you and my new self for the magic available to us in the form of Safari&#39;s abilities to parse complex web content. In my experience, there&#39;s nothing like it (at least nothing available to regular consumers.)</span></p><p><span>The screenshot embedded above shows the result of a </span><code>Quick Look</code><span> action inserted just after the </span><code>Text</code><span> action produced by the public version of my shortcut when run on our example. There are three immediately problematic issues:</span></p><ol start='' ><li><span>Siri doesn&#39;t understand roman numerals, so she will read &quot;Johnny Tsunami VI&quot; as </span><em><span>Johnny Tsunami vee eye</span></em><span>.</span></li><li><span>&quot;The Psalms&quot; is not my name, though it is what this blog currently returns when asked for a byline. In my experience, this generally isn&#39;t an issue with most mainstream media CMSs.</span></li><li><span>The shortcut appears to have failed to retrieve any data for the </span><code>Published Date</code><span> variable from my blog. (Also a relatively specific consideration.)</span></li></ol><p><span>If you&#39;ll note in the </span><em><span>previous</span></em><span> embedded image comparing my custom version of the shortcut (left) to the published version (right,) you&#39;ll note that my chosen solution is to manually input all metadata before actually starting the shortcut. What&#39;s not shown is my corresponding manual inputs in the </span><code>Encode Trimmed Media</code><span> action, which includes attaching a retrieved image file (in the Working Copy action you </span><em><span>can</span></em><span> see) as album art. For my intended use - exclusively generating text-to-speech audio of Posts on this blog - this makes more sense than unnecessarily automating metadata retrieval.</span></p><p><span>The extraordinary thing about the screenshot, though, is that it doesn&#39;t contain any of the other crap (as described above) found in the original page. (Beforehand, it looked more </span><a href='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/extratone/bilge/main/posts/johnny-tsunami-smart-house-slavery.md'><span>like this</span></a><span>.) It&#39;s especially reliable at parsing WordPress-bound content, which still makes up </span><span>[</span><span>s̵͕̈́͊c̶̥̏̚r̶̥͈̃è̴̙͌å̴̹m̵̛̅ͅi̶̦̾͘n̸͎̟̎̃g̶͎͛</span><span>]</span><span> percent of the whole web. </span><strong><span>Treasure this power</span></strong><span>, folks.</span></p><p><img src="https://i.snap.as/OMwKdOUI.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" alt="Simpler TTS Examples"></p><p><span>If all you need read aloud is the body text, things become even simpler. In the right example above, I&#39;ve simply deleted the </span><code>Text</code><span> action and replaced it with </span><code>Get text from [the Safari Web Article&#39;s body]</code><span>. Theoretically, one could omit that action, even, and simply use the direct output of </span><code>Get Body from Article</code><span> as input for the </span><code>Make spoken audio from text</code><span> action, but I say keep the extra step unless it becomes an issue.</span></p><p><strong><span>If you&#39;re actually </span><em><span>beginning</span></em><span> with clean plain text</span></strong><span> and don&#39;t care about metadata in your final audio file and/or if you&#39;re planning on passing the result through other audio/metadata editing software, anyway, the left, three-action shortcut is all you need. It will result in a </span><a href='https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Core_Audio_Format'><span>Core Audio Format (.caf)</span></a><span> file (like </span><a href='https://github.com/extratone/bilge/blob/main/audio/egg.caf'><span>this one</span></a><span>,) which I know absolutely nothing about except that Audacity and GarageBand support it by default.</span></p><h3 id='sharingembedding'><span>Sharing/Embedding</span></h3><p><span>Whichever route you traveled, you should have some sort of audio file, at this point, and if you intend to share and/or embed it, you’ll need to upload said audio to some sort of Web Server which allows direct playback/download of the raw file from external sources. Unless you’ve been skimming, you know by now that I’ve been using </span><em><a href='https://github.com/extratone/bilge'><span>The Psalms</span></a></em><a href='https://github.com/extratone/bilge'><span> GitHub Repository</span></a><span> to do this thus far, though one isn’t really supposed to. Every few months, someone on Stack Overflow figures out how to construct or discover the raw link to a given Google Drive file before Google notices and alters it, and I’m afraid you’ll find just about every other cloud/file sharing service in a similarly unreliable situation. If it’s going to be done at scale, I’m afraid it’s ultimately going to require you rent regular, vanilla space on an FTP-enabled fileserver, if one can still do that sort of thing. (I will update this post if/when I find a more ideal solution.)</span></p><p><span>Within my current system, the raw URL to our example file looks like this:</span></p><pre class="md-fences md-end-block ty-contain-cm modeLoaded" spellcheck="false" lang=""><div class="CodeMirror cm-s-inner cm-s-null-scroll CodeMirror-wrap" lang=""><div style="overflow: hidden; position: relative; width: 3px; height: 0px; top: 26.5961px; left: 19.9875px;"><textarea autocorrect="off" autocapitalize="off" spellcheck="false" tabindex="0" style="position: absolute; bottom: -1em; padding: 0px; width: 1000px; height: 1em; outline: none;"></textarea></div><div class="CodeMirror-scrollbar-filler" cm-not-content="true"></div><div class="CodeMirror-gutter-filler" cm-not-content="true"></div><div class="CodeMirror-scroll" tabindex="-1"><div class="CodeMirror-sizer" style="margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px;"><div style="position: relative; top: 0px;"><div class="CodeMirror-lines" role="presentation"><div role="presentation" style="position: relative; outline: none;"><div class="CodeMirror-measure"><pre><span>xxxxxxxxxx</span></pre></div><div class="CodeMirror-measure"></div><div style="position: relative; z-index: 1;"></div><div class="CodeMirror-code" role="presentation"><div class="CodeMirror-activeline" style="position: relative;"><div class="CodeMirror-activeline-background CodeMirror-linebackground"></div><div class="CodeMirror-gutter-background CodeMirror-activeline-gutter" style="left: 0px; width: 0px;"></div><pre class=" CodeMirror-line " role="presentation"><span role="presentation" style="padding-right: 0.1px;">https://github.com/extratone/bilge/raw/main/audio/TTS/JohnnyTsunami.m4a</span></pre></div></div></div></div></div></div><div style="position: absolute; height: 0px; width: 1px; border-bottom: 0px solid transparent; top: 25px;"></div><div class="CodeMirror-gutters" style="display: none; height: 25px;"></div></div></div></pre><p><span>Using my aforelinked, ultra rudimentary </span><a href='https://routinehub.co/shortcut/9948/'><span>&lt; audio &gt; element Siri Shortcut tool</span></a><span> (which I’ve kept on my homescreen with good results for a few months,) we can very quickly turn said raw URL into a properly-formatted HTML5 audio player:</span></p><pre class="md-fences md-end-block ty-contain-cm modeLoaded" spellcheck="false" lang=""><div class="CodeMirror cm-s-inner cm-s-null-scroll CodeMirror-wrap" lang=""><div style="overflow: hidden; position: relative; width: 3px; height: 0px; top: 26.5922px; left: 19.9875px;"><textarea autocorrect="off" autocapitalize="off" spellcheck="false" tabindex="0" style="position: absolute; bottom: -1em; padding: 0px; width: 1000px; height: 1em; outline: none;"></textarea></div><div class="CodeMirror-scrollbar-filler" cm-not-content="true"></div><div class="CodeMirror-gutter-filler" cm-not-content="true"></div><div class="CodeMirror-scroll" tabindex="-1"><div class="CodeMirror-sizer" style="margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px;"><div style="position: relative; top: 0px;"><div class="CodeMirror-lines" role="presentation"><div role="presentation" style="position: relative; outline: none;"><div class="CodeMirror-measure"><pre><span>xxxxxxxxxx</span></pre></div><div class="CodeMirror-measure"></div><div style="position: relative; z-index: 1;"></div><div class="CodeMirror-code" role="presentation"><div class="CodeMirror-activeline" style="position: relative;"><div class="CodeMirror-activeline-background CodeMirror-linebackground"></div><div class="CodeMirror-gutter-background CodeMirror-activeline-gutter" style="left: 0px; width: 0px;"></div><pre class=" CodeMirror-line " role="presentation"><span role="presentation" style="padding-right: 0.1px;">&lt;audio controls&gt;</span></pre></div><pre class=" CodeMirror-line " role="presentation"><span role="presentation" style="padding-right: 0.1px;">  &lt;source src="https://github.com/extratone/bilge/raw/main/audio/TTS/JohnnyTsunami.m4a"&gt;</span></pre><pre class=" CodeMirror-line " role="presentation"><span role="presentation" style="padding-right: 0.1px;">&lt;/audio&gt;</span></pre></div></div></div></div></div><div style="position: absolute; height: 0px; width: 1px; border-bottom: 0px solid transparent; top: 76px;"></div><div class="CodeMirror-gutters" style="display: none; height: 76px;"></div></div></div></pre><p><span>Ideally, on the final, reader-facing page, said code should create a player like this:</span></p><!--more--><p><span>If further configuration of the player is desired or necessary, see </span><a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/audio'><span>this Mozilla page</span></a><span> for a full list of supported options.

(Thanks again, Tom.) Without any tweaking, I was able to run the shortcut (from within the Shortcuts app since the Share Sheet appears to be thoroughly fucked at the moment) in a reasonable amount of time - less than 5 minutes, more than 2 - and generate the file embedded below. Notably, I also used a different hosting service - </span><a href='https://mastodon.social/web/statuses/106798701662102859'><span>mastodon.social</span></a><span> - but I certainly don’t plan on doing so at scale and neither should you.</span></p><!--more--><p><span>Honestly, </span><em><span>Input</span></em><span>’s CMS is the cleverest challenge I was able to come up with for this single-day-old shortcut of mine, and I’m quite proud of the result.

</audio><p><span>Eighty days ago, Apple&#39;s Senior Vice President of Software Engineering </span><span>~</span><span>~</span><span>stood up in front of a crowd of</span><span>~</span><span>~</span><span>...</span></p><p><span>No!... It was just me... Alone, in my mother’s basement, on a Monday morning, contorted at stupid angles, typing to my phone with a physical keyboard and unapologetically scarfing as much as I possibly could of the Apple community’s unbelievably unreserved, almost </span><em><span>spiritual</span></em><span> volume of </span><strong><span>pure hype</span></strong><span> from as many simultaneous sources as I could manage. (Hilariously, </span><em><span>all</span></em><span> of said sources are/were Discord servers, now, as in that “gamer” communications service I launched my little indie mag on in 2015 and </span><a href='https://bilge.world/discord-slack-comparison'><span>kept comparing to Slack</span></a><span>, but like an actual madman.)</span></p><p><span>Anyway, said Senior Vice President of Software Engineering (who we are encouraged to hold accountable for basically all technical changes to iOS) is named Craig, and these are his first few sentences:</span></p><blockquote><p><code>For many of us, our iPhone has become indispensable. And at the heart of iPhone is iOS. iOS powers the experiences we&#39;ve come to rely on. This year, we were inspired to create even more meaningful ways iPhone could help you. Our new release is iOS 15. It&#39;s packed with features that make the iOS experience adapt to and complement the way you use iPhone...</code></p></blockquote><p><span>I’m dwelling on them because they are </span><strong><span>patently meaningless</span></strong><span>. Very little to nothing coming in iOS 15 is what I would call </span><em><span>ease-of-use-centric</span></em><span>. Some of it - namely controversial (and now backpedaled) changes to the user interface of Safari - feels almost maliciously quartered in the opposite direction. Most of the changes in the subheadings of </span><strong><a href='https://www.apple.com/ios/ios-15-preview/features/'><span>the full feature list</span></a></strong><span> are simply irrelevant in the use for all but the dorkiest iOS users, like myself, and I find the fact unacceptable, at the very least.</span></p><p><img src="https://i.snap.as/t2IieKLq.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" alt="The Foundation Image"></p><p><span>This is why I would like to try something different, this year, and focus on an entirely different audience: my family, as representatives of the vast majority of the iPhone’s billion-something demographic (read: customers.) That is to say, who Craig </span><em><span>should</span></em><span> be referring to with the phrase “most of us.” Not because I believe them to be “dumb” or “end users” (in the tech bro derogatory sense,) but because they are busy, working people who depend on their iPhone as a </span><em><span>utilitarian</span></em><span> device, above all else. They don’t have the time to dive deep into Apple documentation or watch the whole WWDC presentation to gain an understanding of where to look for new features or (unfortunately) how to turn them off. Realistically, they don’t even have time to read this whole Post, though I hope they will (sorry fam.)</span></p><!--more--><p><span>Regardless of how we feel about it, Apple has made it clear that our phones are going to be further and further inundated with automated processes in the background. Whether you like it or not, your phone is going to be used to help find other users’ devices over the Find My network, your travel information is going to be used to inform Apple Maps’ live traffic statistics, and so on. For the more conservative members of my family, related truths about their phones are going to continue to feel like we are continuing to give up “ownership” of our devices. There are definitive alternatives, but they involve giving up a whole lot of conveniences. I will do my best to address this a bit later on, drawing from much more articulate critics than I.</span></p><p><img src="https://i.snap.as/eBBnwCIn.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" alt="Testing Home Screens for iOS 15"></p><p><span>What I </span><em><span>will</span></em><span> dwell on, myself, are the more menial, tactile implications of these abstract changes in design philosophy. A general theme of my own use/writing about iOS has been re-finding or jury-rigging the “buttons” which are gradually being obscured or eliminated entirely in the assumption that Apple’s automation knows better than us users when something should happen or change. A great example: using </span><a href='https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/ac6a4587d5b54abc934631c214d81c0c'><span>a simple Siri Shortcut</span></a><span> to completely disable Wi-Fi and Bluetooth instead of trusting the </span><a href='https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208086'><span>unnecessarily complex conditions</span></a><span> of doing so with the buttons in Control Center. I have sought out these “hacks” (as other iOS powerusers have rather absurdly called them) for very selfish reasons.</span></p><!--more--><p><img src="https://i.snap.as/oHqejXq1.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" alt="Safari Settings in iOS 15"></p><h2 id='the-gist'><span>The Gist</span></h2><p><span>Rounder, still! From the first time you enter your passcode immediately after installing iOS 15, you’ll notice that Notifications and other elements have had their rounded corners </span><em><span>further</span></em><span> rounded, for some reason. Assuming Safari ships with its new look turned on by default, the screenshots embedded above show two locations (subject to change) where one can switch it off. (Your best bet is to visit </span><strong><a href='prefs:root=SAFARI'><span>its menu in Settings</span></a></strong><span> as displayed on the right in </span><code>Settings ⇨ Safari</code><span>.) As of this writing, at least two of iOS 15’s “headlining” features have been pushed to further iterative updates: </span><a href='https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/ios-15-apple-shareplay-tv-delay-b1904548.html'><span>SharePlay</span></a><span> and </span><a href='https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/25/icloud-private-relay-ios-15-public-beta/'><span>iCloud Private Relay</span></a><span>. I suspect you will be prompted to explore Focus Modes upon initial installation, which I will eventually analyze in relative detail. Ideally, you’ll also be prompted to explore “Shared With You,” which I personally believe to be the release’s most significant addition for most people, by far.</span></p><p><span>As far as &quot;meaningful ways iPhone could help you,&quot; I see little more than glimmers. Focus Modes would be promising were they not so complex to set up, and Notification Summaries are (as of this moment) a pretty hopeless implementation of a theoretically useful concept. Some additional filters in Apple Maps search will prove useful so long as the associated metadata has been updated for locations </span><em><span>other</span></em><span> than San Francisco (say, mid-Missouri.)

Since </span><a href='https://bilge.world/mono-audio-playback'><span>one of my very first written works on tech</span></a><span> was/is directly related to the subject, though, indulge me for just a moment for an attempted explanation. Firstly, I must note that only two audio channels (the stereo experiences in various forms you’ve certainly had in your life, regardless of who you are) are necessary for audio to become “spatial.” If you’re curious about this, </span><a href='https://pudding.cool/2018/02/waveforms/'><span>my favorite all-time web experience from </span></a><em><a href='https://pudding.cool/2018/02/waveforms/'><span>The Pudding</span></a></em><span> is an absolutely impeccable next destination. Secondly, the actual technology behind Apple’s title was not developed by Apple, but by Dolby. It’s not that Apple doesn’t acknowledge this thoroughly in </span><a href='https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212182'><span>their explainer docs</span></a><span>, nor is Dolby by any means a wee organization in need of my amplification, but this is one of those Apple habits that’s become a particular peev.

The biggest possible miss, here, was adamantly missed: one </span><em><span>cannot</span></em><span> customize away the “Home” timeline from the first nav bar position, which brings up another huge issue with expecting a monthly fee for an experience within Twitter’s iOS app: </span><em><span>persistence</span></em><span>. </span></p><p><a href='https://twitter.com/neoyokel/status/1467393675579871234' target='_blank' class='url'>https://twitter.com/neoyokel/status/1467393675579871234</a></p><p><span>In the clip of the Twitter feedback Space embedded above, my second point of note was that the app had not “randomly logged me out” in the seven days I’d then been subscribed to Twitter Blue. To be clear, this was referring to the experience of opening the Twitter for iOS app to the welcome screen instead of where one left off, which has indeed happened in the interim. The worst bit: after logging back in again, all one’s app preferences are reset to their respective defaults. Without a means of exporting or “backing up” one’s settings - like say, </span><a href='https://better.tw'><span>Better Tweetdeck</span></a><span> has - this means that one has to methodically explore every single Settings menu and re-select core essentials like posting the highest quality possible images, for instance, all with the knowledge that such a reset could happen again at any time. Suffice it to say, this is not the sort of quality one expects from a premium iOS app in 2021. </span></p><p><a href='https://twitter.com/neoyokel/status/1463658007791812608' target='_blank' class='url'>https://twitter.com/neoyokel/status/1463658007791812608</a></p><p><span>As you’ll see in the screenshot embedded above, Custom Navigation offers one a choice of up to 6 tabs from a total of 10, which include </span><a href='https://github.com/ExtraKeys/keys/issues/31#issuecomment-986184090'><span>some Bluetooth keyboard shortcut considerations</span></a><span> I suspect you’ll not find detailed from any other source. </span></p><h3 id='bluetooth-keyboard-shortcuts-support'><span>Bluetooth Keyboard Shortcuts Support</span></h3><p><span>To start, </span><code>⌘ + F</code><span> will now reliably open the Explore tab and (most of the time) deliver one’s cursor directly to its search field. However, </span><strong><span>this only functions when Explore has been selected as one of the bottom nav tabs</span></strong><span>, which really misses out on an opportunity for the shortcut to be uniquely useful, in my view. Otherwise, </span><code>⌘ + 1-6</code><span> will open the bottom tabs you’ve chosen in order, which means - brace yourselves - that Twitter Blue’s Custom Navigation technically includes </span><em><span>configurable keyboard shortcuts</span></em><span>.</span></p><p><a href='https://twitter.com/neoyokel/status/1467681892468154370' target='_blank' class='url'>https://twitter.com/neoyokel/status/1467681892468154370</a></p><p><span>Also notable: when viewing the obligatory Home tab, one can navigate between their Lists with just the (unmodified) left and right arrow keys!  </span><code>⌘ + ,</code><span> is now a dependable way of opening the app’s Settings menu, </span><code>⌘ + \</code><span> pulls up the account switcher, </span><code>⌘ + =,-,0</code><span> manipulates text size, app-wide. </span><code>⌘ + V</code><span> will open Tweets from links in one’s clipboard from anywhere in the app - not a new trick, I don’t think, but a clever one.

Yet another beautifully absurd product oversight.</span></p><p><span>From the screenshot embedded above, it’s quite obvious that I no longer use Twitter’s Direct Messages, but there was a time,  many years ago, when I would have personally appreciated “</span><strong><span>Pinned Conversations</span></strong><span>” very much.</span></p><p><img src="https://i.snap.as/7RBw18tJ.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" alt="Ad-Free Articles in Safari - Twitter Blue"></p><h2 id='ad-free-articles'><span>Ad-Free Articles</span></h2><p><span>As much as I want to unabashedly celebrate the investment Twitter, Inc. is inexplicably now demonstrating in Lists - a feature I’ve </span><a href='https://bilge.world/twitter-lists'><span>tirelessly advocated for</span></a><span> out of perceived obscurity - with Twitter Blue, there’s at least one example which they’ve managed to fuck up such investment.

Aside from that anecdote, I have another which is both mostly personal and yet inexcludable. </span></p><p><span>The day </span><a href='https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22711233/scroll-shutting-down-twitter-blue-standalone-subscription-ad-free-article-service'><span>Twitter acquired Scroll</span></a><span>, I had the bizarre, completely unexpected opportunity to ask Tony Haile - Scroll’s founder, who also played a substantial role in creating the Ad-Tech Hell it was founded to counter in creating Chartbeat, some years ago - </span><em><span>a question</span></em><span>. I’d been listening to a Twitter Space hosted by </span><a href='https://twitter.com/chrismessina'><span>Chris Messina</span></a><span> and </span><a href='https://twitter.com/brianmcc'><span>Brian McCullough</span></a><span> for </span><em><span>TechMeme</span></em><span> featuring Haile while I’d been showering. Somehow, the two ran out of questions to ask Tony, so they turned to the audience. I requested to speak and Chris - who’d done so a few times before - let me in almost immediately.</span></p><p><span>Nude and still very wet, standing in my bathroom, I suddenly found myself on a call, essentially, with certainly the most interesting media industry figure of the moment. Chris, who knew me well enough already as a regular in his Spaces to know my speech often includes long pauses, said something like “quickly.” I began by bringing back a topic from an hour before, at least, and noted that Twitter’s “Tips” feature was no more than a list of hyperlinks as it stood (it basically still is,) before (more or less verbatim:)</span></p><p><span>“I just got out of the shower but uh… I forgot about Tony Haile. (yes, he was listening directly to the Space and I did say that) …but I would ask him to narrate how exactly he got from Chartbeat to Scroll to Twitter.” Yes, I spoke of him in the third person even though I could all but hear him breathing. I then retired from my speaking role, but - from what I could tell, passively listening as I finished getting ready for some time-sensitive engagement - my question basically sustained the rest of the interview. </span></p><p><span>This experience, alone, wouldn’t necessarily be worth mentioning, but after discovering </span><em><span>The Kansas City Star</span></em><span> - one of the oldest, most established local mastheads to my home state (Missouri,) to which I maintain a subscription - among the aforelinked List list of participating publishers in Twitter Blue’s Ad-Free Articles program, I reached out to the one </span><em><span>Star</span></em><span> reporter I know, asking simply if she’d heard anything whatsoever about the program from editors or just ambiently in the newsroom. She had not. </span></p><p><span>For an explanation, I dug just a bit further and found out the </span><em><span>Stars</span></em><span>’ corporate owner, McClatchy, had in fact </span><a href='https://www.niemanlab.org/2020/12/scroll-the-ad-free-news-startup-will-experiment-with-bundled-subscriptions-at-eight-mcclatchy-sites/'><span>“tested” a “partnership” with Scroll before</span></a><span>, and appeared to have opted its whole handful of local American news institutions - including the </span><em><span>Star</span></em><span> - in again, en masse, to its new, Twitter-owned form. </span></p><p><span>Before I go on, I should note that one can indeed utilize Ad-Free articles’ benefit within your preferred web browser, but the process is very specific.

There’s a specific bit of the conversation between </span><a href='https://twitter.com/alisonbuki'><span>@alisonbuki</span></a><span> and I in which the term “Poweruser” is actually thrown around regarding my own use of Twitter Lists, Tweetbot, and a few other </span><em><span>Hax</span></em><span> to consume content </span><em><span>deliberately</span></em><span>. I think I failed somewhere in my portrayal of this curation and miscommunicated the nature of what I was trying to get at by “making use of the tools available to you.” Regarding the actual manhours involved in the configuration I was trying to evangelize, I think I’ve spent more time trying to describe the effort than I have actually configuring my own content intake. </span></p><p><span>Long before I was </span><a href='https://bit.ly/dbfollow'><span>follow-limited</span></a><span> in 2017, I lived entirely in my </span><a href=''><span>Twitter Lists</span></a><a href='https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/lists' target='_blank' class='url'>https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/lists</a><span>), the largest of which I built up “organically” over time, by adding appropriate accounts one by one as I came across them. Thanks to Tweetbot, my equivalent of the native apps’s Home timeline is a private List of ~200 accounts whose users represent the actual entirety of my adult social life, past to present. Then, there’s </span><a href='https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/lists/the-new'><span>The New</span></a><span>, which - I must admit - has grown beyond its original scope and sortof become my follow list, with enough exceptions that I consider it worthwhile to keep public. Then, there’s the newest - </span><a href='https://twitter.com/i/lists/768458273141907456'><span>my Meta-Media List</span></a><span> - and the very oldest: my dear, weathered </span><a href='https://twitter.com/i/lists/43457439'><span>Rolodex of Automotive Twitter</span></a><span>. I keep Tweetbot in my dock and the native app on my device just for notifications, Spaces, and now Communities. That’s it! Yet, using this configuration, I </span><em><span>never</span></em><span> see content that seriously disturbs, shames, triggers, or otherwise upsets me beyond reason or expectation</span><span>[^5]</span><span>, but am regularly exposed to a relatively diverse palette of perspectives, and just generally find my consumption/engagement time on the service meaningfully spent. </span></p><p><span>The particular amalgamation of truly half-assed user experience features offered in Twitter Blue lend toward a narrative about this company which we collectively have continued to fall for literally </span><em><span>dozens</span></em><span> of times - often in immediate succession - throughout the fewer years of its history: that it </span><em><span>finally</span></em><span> has a morsel of what </span><em><span>might just become</span></em><span> a cohesive vision. Clearly, I am as susceptible to this as anyone considering how quickly I jumped to celebrating the fact that </span><em><span>finally</span></em><span>, Twitter had seen the humongous value to be imparted to its userbase by simply adding basic configurables like custom navigation and especially refining the essential curatorial tool that is Lists. </span></p><p><span>Were I still a person who wastes my energy speculating on the real happenings within Twitter, Inc, though, an entirely different, much more realistic sounding theory arises after the analysis we’ve trudged through together in this post: every single item on Twitter Blue’s feature list represents the absolute bare minimum resource investment possible. If I had any money, I’d go on to bet that </span><a href='https://twitter.com/jpeguin'><span>Shihab Mehboob</span></a><span> could have built from scratch every single developmental “addition” to the iOS app Twitter Blue includes in a matter of hours, though from experience, I seriously doubt he’d ever allow such lackluster work to reach even beta tester’s fingers. As far as Ad-Free Articles go, Twitter hasn’t even bothered to swap out all the Scroll branding. The fact that </span><em><span>I</span></em><span> had to surface the concept of Delete and Re-Draft to Twitter Employee brains for what all appearances indicate was the first time in that “FeedbackFriday” Twitter Space represents a truly sickening lack of effort. No, the story that aligns much more succinctly in the grander context is that Twitter Blue just happened to be the first disjointed, scatterbrained subscription service pitch to finally fall out the rectum of this miraculously bunk organization, but all you motherfuckers can talk about is Japple Notes Dorsey walking out, and </span><em><span>what it could mean</span></em><span>.</span></p><p><span>Since I have now actually been personally and explicitly invited to share feedback regarding Twitter Blue, I suppose I’ll make some effort to send them this hyperlink. In that vein, I think I’ll end with some advice addressed directly to Twitter, Incorporated:</span></p><p><span>Hey Twitter! If you ever find yourself genuinely interested in selling a subscription product long term, as a mutual value exchange with your users, make all of Twitter Blue’s features available to all users, and ditch Scroll entirely. Instead of placing the bet on local newspapers like </span><em><span>The Kansas City Star</span></em><span>, it should be on </span><em><span>you</span></em><span> to </span><strong><span>take the financial risk yourself, and offer, simply, a completely ad-free Twitter experience</span></strong><span>.
