# Mike Spinelli, Travis Okulski, Doug Demuro

# The new C7 Stingray

I'll get right to theÂ&nbsp;cool stuff, Matt put 300 miles on a brand new **C7 Corvette Stingray** and Zack spent some time with the **2014 911 Turbo S**. Â&nbsp;Now the rest of this post is likely superfluous but what kind of sorry excuse for a podcaster/blogger would I be if I didn't expound a bit?

Beyond two of the biggest names in sporting things with 4 wheels, Matt and Zack both made their ways to Europe and brought us the gift of stories from the "old country"Â&nbsp;and likely unending jealousy for many of our listeners. Â&nbsp;Matt visited **Koenigsegg** and spent some time with their test driver as they flogged an **Agera R** for an afternoon; you know when he wasn't busy touring the continent in a brand new **M6 CoupÃ©** (accent added for additional euro flavour (also the u because I'm feeling international)). Â&nbsp;Whilst making his way across the continent the M6 may or may not have spanked a **Ferrari 458. Â&nbsp;**

If that wasn't enough Zack flew over to Germany to film the 2014 911 Turbo S for Tangent Vector, and it seems as though Porsche may have produced a car that is good. Â&nbsp;In a different part of the country Matt was busy making his way around the** NÃ¼rburgring Nordschleife** because racecar.

Oh yeah, and of course everybody is back from Pebble Beach and the Concours d'Elegance. Â&nbsp;We make fun of snooty old money guys wearing stupid pants, the autmotive journalists who believe they're mocking them (even though they really aren't) and our plans for next years appearance at Pebble.

All of that and the requisite number of dick and fart jokes.

Â&nbsp;

Â&nbsp;Zack and ThadÂ&nbsp;share tales of drag racing station wagons. Â&nbsp;We thoroughly lambast the appearance of the Shelby Raptor, lust over a 64 Corvette autocross special, Matt reviews the Range Rover Sport, we say many kind words about [Greg Fitzsimmons](http://www.gregfitzsimmons.com/) and more...

Â&nbsp;

# GarageBand Sucks

So... this week as we wrapped up recording and I attempted to save the recording (like the reckless asshole I am) GarageBand promptly started throwing a fit and ultimately destroyed the second half of the recording.

Since we got a solid hour of podcasting in before the recording was trashed I decided an hour of a quality podcasting was better than none.

# TST Podcast - Back from SEMA

We are back from SEMA and there's a new 1987 Porsche 911 sitting in the parking lot. Matt has picked up his car for a Leh Keen Safari project, and spent 1,000 miles getting to know it. Zack also gives his perspective on the car and its unique driving habits. We also discuss the new top speed record, SEMA truck trends, the 6-wheeled Raptor, and a lot more.Â&nbsp;

# Anthony Lahner of Exoticar

Anthony Lahner started his career painting wheels in alleys, but now he runs a company that can restore or perfect the look of any car.Â&nbsp;We interview him in the second half of the show, after Matt and Zack talk about drifting and bad car movies.

He brought Matt's R32 GT-R back to factory-fresh and upholstered the interior of his Mustang, but he's done far more than that, from cutting his teeth working at a luxury service center to painting out of a van. He's learned which luxury cars are cheap, what causes some weird Ferrari problems, how to protect you car, and has some funny stories about the early days.

In addition, Zack took his E46 drifting- finally- and saw some interesting match ups at the track, so we compare the drifting dynamics of an M3, a 240SX, and the other things we've slid. Topics also include a hilariously-bad car movie from the 80s, why gasoline gets hot, and plenty more.Â&nbsp;

# Porsche Dragger- Manuel Carrillo III

After leaving radio to work in the middle of Australia, Manuel Carrillo III found a job around hs favorite thing: cars. He writes for a large number of websites, films and photograhs, but his focus right now is restoring the Porsche 911 he was driven home in after he was born. Yanked from cluttered garage, he dragged it to SEMA in its current state; a car that was honest about where it had been. He talks to us about the car's journey, and a broken Mustang that seems impossible to fix.Â&nbsp;

Other topics include the duration of a Safari build, the upcoming Radwood 2 show, cheap 90s cars, and how to make $150,000 into $80,000.Â&nbsp;

# Aaron Gold and Brian Makse

Aaron Gold -one of our funniest and most frequent guests- returns, and he brought a friend, automotive YouTuber Brian Makse.Â&nbsp; V12 vs V8s, spool valves, crashing, forbidden cars; this episode has it all.Â&nbsp;  
Â&nbsp;

Aaron has been in this business for decades, and always has an interesting take on a car, a few strange interests (usually featuring diesel) and a bevy of odd voices to help paint a picture. Brian has been talking about cars on YouTube for 4 years, and tested a mess of performance cars. The guys start off the show comparing new Astons to new Bentleys, leading to a debate of V8s vs V12s. Later in the show Brian talks about suspension damping and spool valves, the Chevrolet ZR2, forbidden cars, the 25 year ban, near-misses in racing, and a lot more.Â&nbsp;

Today we interview the man in charge, Nik Saran, about why he likes superchargers, how to make power without breaking things, BMW M4s vs Mercedes C63s, supercharging Lamborghinis, and a lot more. This was a great talk, and we learned a lot.Â&nbsp;

# Alan Macey - (Manual Gearbbox Preservation Society)

Alan Macey thinks about cars differently than we do. After graduating from Art Center of Pasadena (arguably the best school for automotive design in the world), he interned at VW, and then worked as a designer at Jeep. He sees cars differently than us. We see a panel gap, and he knows why it's that size. He understands the constraints designers have when they design a new car. He also created the Manual Gearbox Preservation Society ( links below).Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp;We talk about design, Bugatti, VW, challenges of selling a new car, and then we get into a DEEP conversation about AI, the future of car ownership, and argue about how soon it will all arrive.Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp;It's a good listen.Â&nbsp;

# Remembering Chef Carl Ruiz

Our good friend Chef Carl Ruiz of The Food Network, La Cubana NYC Restaurant, the Opie Radio Podcast and countless other ventures, suddenly passed away over the weekend. While we are all reeling from his death, I want to take the opportunity to celebrate Carl's amazing appearance on our other show, Watch &amp; Listen. This episode focuses on Carl's general philosophy on watches, which I later titled, "Carl Ruins Everything." And it's the best primer on watches for someone who loves, or who hates watches.Â&nbsp;

This episode is available as a video - get it at:Â&nbsp;https://youtu.be/VZcrVQtHbXE

# Brad Brownell (Radwood, Flatsixes.com, Jalopnik, and more!)

Brad Brownell is one of the busiest people in the automotive circle. He's a co-founder of Radwood and writes for more publications than we can count. Instead of flying to press events, he drives a yellow Porsche 912E, sometimes for thousands of miles at a time. We call him a glutton for punishment but he couldn't be happier. We talk about his recent motorcycle reviews, crashing, advanced dirt riding, what Harley is up to, upcoming Radwood events, and his new project, Autotopia2099.

Dan Prosser is an automotive journalist based in the UK.

"Motor MythBustersâ€”coming only to the MotorTrend App, August 4, 2021â€”picks up where the Discovery Channel classic left off, but tackles each myth with a gearhead-minded focus and a more in-depth look at the processâ€”not only the carnage at the end."Â&nbsp;

# Announcement

Weâ€™ve been making this podcast for 10 years thanks to listeners like you. Since the beginning, many people have asked us to get rid of the ads, or leave the live streams up a little longer, or get more content. Well now we have a solution for you! (Don't worry, the show will still be available for free)

Â&nbsp;By becoming a patron you can watch the live stream, ad-free episodes, get access to the shows long before the general public, or even get a special once-a-month crew show that is only for our Patrons. And it all starts at just $3 a month.Â&nbsp;

Read about the tiers below or hit the link to see a thorough description. Â&nbsp;Join our Patreon: [https://www.patreon.com/thesmokingtirepodcastÂ&nbsp;](https://www.patreon.com/thesmokingtirepodcast )

Â&nbsp;

**Hereâ€™s how it works**.Â&nbsp;

**TIER 1: Youâ€™re on our Pit Crew!**Â&nbsp;

_Â&nbsp;Want to watch the podcast live stream_? This is how you do it. The day before the show, we will share the link to the live broadcast with the community and youâ€™ll get a notification when it goes live, so make sure you keep your notifications on.Â&nbsp;

Â&nbsp;

**Tier 2: Crew Chief**Â&nbsp;

The Crew Chief is one of the most valuable members on a race team so weâ€™re giving you a lot of value. Tier 2 patrons not only get to watch the live broadcast, **they also get ad-free episodes from this day forward**. When we publish the episode for the general public, youâ€™ll receive a notification that ad-free versions have been posted right here on Patreon. What if you want to listen on the go? During a commute? We got you covered. Our patron-only RSS feed contains ad-free versions of episodes (starting with episode 650) and our entire back catalog. That's all our content in one single subscription.Â&nbsp;

Â&nbsp;

**Tier 3: Pro DriverÂ&nbsp;**

Letâ€™s be honest, drivers get the best perks. Drivers get **everything the other tiers get PLUS: Early access to episodes** \- Missed the live broadcast? No problem. The moment we end the live stream we publish it for you to enjoy on your schedule. No more waiting a week or two for it to be published. **And, we will record 1-hour crew show, airing once a month, that's only available to Pro Drivers.** We'll dive deeper on the cars we've driven AND answer your questions.
